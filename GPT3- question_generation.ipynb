      " A. The final design was a narrow spike rocket engine with a unique multi chamber design well basically the team went away and essentially worked together looking at the basic rocket equations looking at how large does a rocket need to be in terms of how much thrust it actually produces there a spike nozzle engine is special that it s also an altitude compensating rocket nozzle and that means that it can be most efficient at any altitude compared to a conventional rocket nozzle design which is only suited or designed to one particular altitude we ve also designed in multiple combustion chambers into the engine and these fins which divide the combustion chambers not only hold this bike but also allow us to investigate thrust vectoring potentially in the future . \n",
