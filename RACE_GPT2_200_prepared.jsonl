{"prompt":"I lost both of my parents in a tragic car accident when I was five. Fortunately, at that age a child doesn't understand the finality of such an event.\nMany years later, at the age of twenty-three, I was planning my wedding to Sheldon, who came from a complete loving family, the type I expect. Sheldon and I had already bought our first home with a large, beautifully landscaped yard. As the date grew closer and we took ownership of the home, we began to clean, arrange inside and out.\nThe day before our wedding we were putting the final touches to the yard. We were so pleased with the neatness of it all. But one plant puzzled us. A rosebush located just outside our front door, was completely barren of leaves or buds. It looked liked it might be dead, but since neither of us could be sure, we reluctantly decided to keep it for the time being.\nThat same evening, after the dinner, I was too excited to sleep. Instead I decided I needed some quiet time to reflect on the wedding the next day. I went to the backyard and sat in the warm, clear, star-filled night. It was there that I realized the only thing missing from my wedding day would be my parents. There had been no time to think of this until now and the thought filled me with sadness. After all, every girl dreams of having her father walk her down the aisle and her mother there to comfort her anxiety. Alone in the yard, I began speaking to my mom and dad, just as if I had known they were listening.\n\"Give me a sign on my wedding day to let me know you're with me.\"\nThe next day Sheldon's excited voice repeatedly called my name. I rushed to join him at the front door.\n\"I can't believe what I'm about to show you!\"\nHe stood aside.

{"prompt":"When I was 12, I got a part-time job on a dairy farm, milking cows. We milked 65 cows twice a day. One day, I complained to my father about having to go milk those cows, saying it was tiring. He said, you know, boy, to work is a blessing. I looked at the men who'd worked harder. I had a feeling I had been told something really important, but it took many years before it sank in.\n Back then, going to college was a rare privilege. My father told me if I'd picked something to study that I liked doing, I'd always look forward to my work. But he also added, even having a job you hate is better than not having a job at all. I wanted to be a farmer, but I joined a military program to help pay for college. And what started out as an obligation to the Army became a way of life that I had been devoted to for 37 years.\nIn the late 1980s, during a visit to Bangladesh, I saw a woman with her baby on her back, breaking bricks with a hammer. I asked a local officer why they weren't using a machine to make the work easier. He told me a machine would put that lady out of work. And as bad as that woman's job was, it was enough to keep a small family alive. It reminded me of my father's words: to work is a blessing.\n After seeing a lot of people like that woman in Bangladesh, I've come to believe that people without jobs are not free. They're victims of crime, poor health, and depression.

Any large hospital will tell you the number of the accidents that happen in the home is almost the same as those on the road.\nOne of the commonest and most dangerous causes of home accidents is wrong and careless use of electrical equipment. People will continue to use a loose plug or pull out a plug without first turning off the power. In spite of warnings, one will carry an electric heater into the bathroom when he is going to have a bath. Sometimes one forgets to cut off the power before mending a lamp or something else. All this will cause accidents. So the rule about anything that work by electricity is:Switch off before you touch anything and don't pretend you know when you actually don't.\nIf you've got children in the house, it's always best to keep medicines of any kind out of their reach. Otherwise, they may be taken for candies or a new kind of drink.

So, remember not to dry clothes in front of fires, or leave stoves in the middle of rooms where they can easily be knocked over. And don't forget to keep the children away from fire.

{"prompt":"An allowance is an important tool for teaching kids how to budget, save and make their own decisions. Children remember and learn from mistakes when their own dollars are lost or spent foolishly.\nHow large an allowance is appropriate? Experts say there is not right amount. Actual amounts differ from region to region, and from family to family.\nTo set an appropriate allowance for your child, work up a weekly budget. Allow for entertainment expenditures such as movies and snacks. Next, include everyday expenses such as lunch money, bus fare, school supplies. \"If you make the child responsible for these ' ills',\" says Josephine Swanson, a consumer specialist, \" he or she will learn to budget for necessary expenditures.\"\nFinally, add some extra money to make saving possible. If you can, keep your child's allowance in line with that of his friends. A child whose purchasing power falls away below his peers' can feel left out.\nIt can be tough, but avoid excusing your children when they make a mistake with their allowance. When Brooke Stephens was ten and growing up in Jacksonville, her mother gave her $5 a week, $1.75 of which was for bus fare and lunch.\" If you lose your money,\" Brooke's mother told her, \"you walk home.\"\nOne week the girl spent all her allowance in a candy store, then she called home for a ride. \" Mom made me walk home,\" recalls Stephens, now a financial planner in Brooklyn. \" At first I was angry. But I finally realized that she was trying to teach me an important lesson. \"\nExperts advise that an allowance should not be tied directly to a child's daily chores.

{"prompt":"Scientists from England's Newcastle University have discovered that bacteria have the ability to detect smells, according to a study by the university on Sunday.\nThe team of scientists, led by Dr. Reindert Nijland, discovered that bacteria can detect certain types of smell- producing chemicals, including  ammonia   that is produced by other bacteria. Once they sense the smells from other kinds of bacteria, the bacteria will gather together to form a colony   and form a layer of slime   in order to force the competitors out of their area. The response decreases as the distance between the two bacterial colonies increases.\nThat slime, also known as biofilm, is one of the primary causes of infection on many medical implants . Biofilms also slow down ships and are believed to cost the marine industry millions of dollars annually. However, they can also be used to clean up spilled oil floating on the sea, as they grow strong on it.\n\"This is the first evidence of a bacterial 'nose'able to detect potential competitors,\" Dr. Nijland said in the August 15 statement, which confirms that bacteria possess qualities similar to four of the five senses that humans enjoy (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell), the others being touch, taste, and sight.\n\"The fact that bacteria formed slime when exposed to ammonia has important significance for understanding how biofilms are formed and how we might be able to use them to our advantage,\" he added.\nTheir findings were published in Sunday's edition of biotechnology journal, and could change the way scientists look at how each of the senses developed over time.\n\"It was thought for a long time that smell existed only in complex living creatures,\" Dr. Nijland said. \"Now we see that bacteria are able to do the same, so the indication is that the ability may have developed even earlier.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" We learn from the text that biofilms   _  . \n\nA. may cause oil to spill\nB. can be used to benefit humans\nC. are the major causes of infection\nD. are more likely to be found on ships\nAnswer = B\n\nWhich of the following describes bacteria correctly? \n\nA.

She thought she heard a low crying up head. \"That's certainly a screech owl,\" her father whispered. \"Let's get a look at it.\" After looking more closely, Annie could see that it was a small owl. Sensing danger, the owl narrowed its eyes and pulled its feathers tightly against its body. Annie carefully wrote down in her notebook that they had seen a screech owl.\nWalking a little farther, they came to a tall oak tree. \"This looks like a perfect spot to attract owls,\" Dad said. \"I'm going to play a recording of common call of the barred owl.

{"prompt":"Magic is believed to have begun with the Egyptians, in 1700 BC. A magician named Dedi of Dedsnefu was reported to have performed for the pharaoh, or the king. He was also known to have entertained the slaves who built the pyramids. The \"Cups and Balls\" trick which he was particularly good at is still performed by magicians all over the world today.\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans were also fascinated by the idea of magic. Actually, one of their main interests was the art of deception . This explains why at that time the priests  even built magic devices into their temples. These devices made it possible for doors to open by themselves and wine to flow magically out of statues' mouths. This was done mainly to convince people that the priests were powerful.\nMagic, however, was not well accepted before the 1800s. Magicians were thought of as freaks  and were only allowed to perform in a circus . It was in the 19th century that the magician Robert Houdin came along and changed people's views and attitudes about magic. It was also because of Robert Houdin that many magicians were able to add Dr. or MD to their names. Today magicians try hard to find new ways to show their practiced skills.

{"prompt":"A recent survey shows that the alarming rate of child suicide  in Hong Kong, raising levels of stress and anxiety among young people, increasing conflicts between children and teachers, and children's complaints that their parents do not understand their problems--all point to a drop in \"emotional quotient\" (EQ)  , the ability to handle relationships.\nEQ is defined as the ability to deal with oneself and others effectively. High EQ, psychologists say, is easy to spot. Some of the greatest humanitarian   leaders have high EQ, along with successful managers and inspirational and respected teachers. The problem is not how to spot high EQ but to improve on low EQ, so society as a whole can benefit.\nIn the United States, declining EQ among young people is seen as one of the factors behind rising young people's crime because youths fail to understand others' feelings--one of the key components of EQ. While the situation in Hong Kong is not so bad, there are warning signs that the levels of anxiety among youth may become critical. Declining EQ among Hong Kong teenagers has been acknowledged by several studies including a key study by the education concern group, the Learning-Teacher Association, which found a high degree of anxiety among students over the future and also that young people lacked confidence in dealing with problems. Parents and teachers will also need to develop their own EQ skills in order to deal with them effectively.\nDaniel Goleman cites a number of basic elements of high EQ: first, awareness of your feelings as you experience them which is very important to making good decisions in life; second, feeling or awareness of what others are feeling. \"90% of emotional information is expressed non-verbally and people vary in their ability to pick it up,\" Dr. Goleman says in his book.\nDr. Goleman argues that without high EQ even highly-educated, highly-intelligent people will not find success in life. Or those with low EQ, even though they may be brilliant, tend to lack feeling and impulse control. They fail easily, and they are easily intolerant and often aggressive in interpersonal relations. Some educational psychologists believe work on EQ may be important in Hong Kong with _ high rate of suicide among school children. EQ test may be able to help predict those most at risk, and those least able to deal with their own emotions or unable to deal with others, including parents and teachers.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" According to the passage, children in Hong Kong commit suicide at an alarming rate as a result of   _  . \n\nA. parents not understanding their children\nB. the rising levels of stress and anxiety among young people\nC. the inability of dealing with relationships\nD. increasing conflict between children and teachers\nAnswer = C\n\nWe can infer from the passage that people with low emotional quotient   _  . \n\nA. are least likely to become good leaders\nB. can deal with oneself and others effectively\nC. are beneficial to society\nD. are more likely to be respected\nAnswer = A\n\nDaniel Goleman believes that   _  . \n\nA. one can be just as successful without having a high EQ\nB. only people with both high EQ and high IQ will be successful in life\nC. people with low intelligence will not get a successful life\nD. people not having high EQ may not be successful in life despite being extremely intelligent\nAnswer = D\n\n"}
{"prompt":"Women teachers are holding back boy students by blaming them for typically male behavior, according to a new study.\nWomen teachers are always saying that boys are \"silly\" in class. They refuse to \"sit nicely like girls\" and are more likely to be addicted to \"schoolboy tricks\".Women teachers may also keep low expectations of boys' academic achievement and encourage girls to work harder by letting them think they are cleverer than boys. The study suggests that under-performance among boys in most national exams could be linked to lower expectations of their women teachers.\nThe researchers did their research mainly on women teachers, since nearly 90 percent of primary school teachers are female. According to the research, women teachers said they often found boys' play in the classroom or in the playground, such as playing with toy guns. The researcher also found that boys were often punished and urged to follow a more feminine style of play instead of being taught how to play responsibly with their favorite toys by their women teachers.\nBonny Hartley, the study's lead author, said, \"By seven or eight years old, children of both boys and girls believe that boys are less focused, less able, and less successful than girls -- and think that adults admit this idea.

{"prompt":"Life is to be enjoyed. There's no point in giving up something you enjoy unless you get something back that's even better. When people eat more healthfully, exercise, quit smoking, and manage stress better, they find that they feel so much better that it reconstructs the reason for making these changes from fear of dying to joy of living. The latest studies show that when you exercise and eat right:\nYOUR BRAIN receives more blood flow and oxygen, so you become smarter, think more clearly, have more energy, and need less sleep. Two studies showed that just walking for three hours per week for only three months caused so many new neurons   to grow that it actually increased the size of people's brains!\nYOUR FACE receives more blood flow, so your skin glows more and wrinkles less. You look younger and more attractive. In contrast, an unhealthy diet, chronic emotional stress and smoking reduce blood flow to your face so you age more quickly. Smoking accelerates aging because nicotine causes your arteries   to narrow down, which decreases blood flow to your face and makes it wrinkle earlier. This is why smokers look years older than they really are.\nYOUR GENES change. In May, a study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showing that changing your lifestyle changes your genes.\nYOUR TELOMERES   get longer. Telomeres are the ends of our chromosomes   that control how long we live. As telomeres become shorter, then cells age more quickly, thus shortening your life.\nBesides, one of the most interesting findings in the study was that the mothers' awareness of stress was more important than what was really occurring in their lives. The researchers gave the women a questionnaire and asked them to rate on a three-point scale how stressed they felt each day, and how out of control their lives felt to them. The women who were aware that they were under heavy stress had significantly shortened and damaged telomeres compared with those who felt more relaxed. On the contrary, some of the women who felt relaxed despite raising a disabled child had more normal-appearing telomeres.\nIn other words, if you feel stressed, you are stressed; if you feel fine, you are fine.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In the author's opinion, when you exercise and eat right, you will experience some changes EXCEPT   _  . \n\nA. brains becoming cleverer\nB. faces having fewer wrinkles\nC. arteries turning narrower\nD. genes being changed\nAnswer = C\n\nThe best title for the passage would be   _  . \n\nA.

{"prompt":"Three Yale University professors agreed in a discussion that the automobile was what one of them called \"Public Health Enemy No. 1 in this century\". Besides polluting the air and overcrowding the cities, cars are involved in more than half the disastrous accidents, and they contribute to heart disease \"because we won't walk anywhere any more,\" said Richard Weeinaman, professor of medicine and public health.\nSpeaking of many of those man-made dangers of the automobile, Arthur W. Galson, professor of biology, said it was possible to make a kerosene-burning turbine car that would \"lessensmog by a very large factor\". But he expressed doubt whether Americans were willing to give up moving about the countryside at 90 miles per hour in a large vehicle. \"America seems wedded to the motor car--every family has to have at least two, and one has to be a convertible   with 300 horsepower,\" professor Galson continued. \"Is this the way of life that we choose because we treasure these values?\"\nFor professor Sears, part of the blame lies with \"a society that regards profit as a supreme value, under the illusion that anything that's technically possible is, therefore, morally justified\". Professor Sears also called the country's dependence on its modern automobiles \"terrible economics\" because of the large horsepower used simply \"moving one individual to work\". But he admitted that Americans have painted themselves into a corner by allowing the national economy to become so dependent on the automobile industry.\n\"The solution,\" Dr Weeinerman said, \"is not finding a less dangerous fuel but a different system of inner city transportation. Because of the increasing use of cars, public transportation has been allowed to wither   and grow worse, so that if you can't walk to where you want to go, you have to have a car in most cities,\" he declared.

Remember to respect the beliefs and opinions of others in the chat room.\nEveryone was new to the network once.  Offer advice when asked by newcomers, as they may not be sure what to do or how to communicate. When someone makes a mistake, whether it's a stupid question or an unnecessarily long answer, be kind about it. If it's a small mistake, you may not need to say anything. Even if you feel strongly about it, think twice before saying anything. Having good manners yourself doesn't give you license to correct everyone else.\nIf you do decide to tell someone about a mistake, point it out politely At the same time, if you find you are wrong, be sure to correct yourself and apologize to those that you have offended.\nIt is not polite to ask others personal questions such as their age, sex and marital status.

I kept asking him to sit down, telling him that he would concentrate better. He sat but seconds later, as if he didn't even notice he was doing it, he got up again. I was getting annoyed, but then it hit me: I started noticing his answers were much quicker and right when he stood up. Could he be focused while standing up?\nThis made me start questioning myself and what I had been raised to believe. I was raised to believe that a quiet child was more likely to succeed. This child would have the discipline to study hard, get good grades and become someone important in life. Kids that were active and loud would only be objects of stares.\nNow people perhaps come to realize that their kids are born with their own sets of DNA and personality features, and all they can do is loving and accepting them. As parents, throughout their growing years and beyond that, we need to be our kids' best cheerleaders, guiding them and helping them find their way.\nI have stopped asking my son to sit down and concentrate. Obviously, he is concentrating, just in his own way and not mine. We need to accept our kids, and their ways of doing things. This way may have worked for me but doesn't mean we need to carry it through generations. There is nothing sweeter than seeing our children being individual .

{"prompt":"Humans and many other mammals have unusually efficient internal temperature regulating systems that automatically maintain stable core body temperatures in cold winters and warm summers. In addition, people have developed cultural patterns and technologies that help them adjust to extremes of temperature and humidity .\nIn very cold climates, there is a constant danger of developing hypothermia , which is a life threatening drop in core body temperature to below normal levels. The normal temperature for humans is about 37.0degC. However, differences in persons and even the time of day can cause it to be as much as 6degC higher or lower in healthy individuals. It is also normal for core body temperature to be lower in elderly people. Hypothermia begins to occur when the core body temperature drops to 34.4degC. Below 29.4degC, the body cools more rapidly because its natural temperature regulating system usually fails. The rapid decline in core body temperature is likely to result in death. However, there have been rare cases in which people have been saved after their temperatures had dropped to 13.9-15.6degC. This happened in 1999 to a Swedish woman who was trapped under an ice sheet in freezing water for 80 minutes. She was found unconscious, not breathing, and her heart had stopped beating, yet she was eventually saved despite the fact that her temperature had dropped to 13.7degC.\nIn extremely hot climates or as a result of uncontrollable infections, core body temperatures can rise to equally dangerous levels. This is hyperthermia. Life threatening hyperthermia typically starts in humans when their temperatures rise to 40.6-41.7degC. Only a few days at this extraordinarily high temperature level is likely to result in the worsening of internal organs and death.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Why can humans keep stable body temperatures in different seasons? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"In a recent class I was asked \"What is a short story?\" My first answer was that it was something that could be read in one sitting and brought an illumination to the reader, sudden and golden like sunlight cracking(, ) through a heavy cloud. I went on to say that in my opinion a \"real\" short story was closer to poetry than to a novel.\nHere are some definitions of the short story. My favorite is Benet's: \"something that can be read in an hour and remembered for a lifetime\". One writer said, \"The theme of a novel won't fit into the framework of a short story; It's like trying to squeeze a large painting done on a wall into the frame of a miniature  .  And as in a miniature painting, the details need to be sharp. \"\nThe short story is an example of one aspect of human nature. Often a character _ some event, something that offers him or her change. This is why it's said that short stories usually \"say something \", often a small something, but sometimes delivered with such accuracy that the effect is strongly felt, even a life-moment for some readers, something similar to a religious experience or to witnessing a never-to-be-repeated scene in nature.\nOk, let's form a definition here: A short story is an account, rarely over 10, 000 words or below 500 words-more commonly 1, 500 to 5, 000 words-a single-sitting read, but with enough time and weight to move the reader. It is narrow and focused to produce an effect through the story, most commonly through events affecting some change in an individual.\nWriter Isabelle Allende once wrote: \"Novels are, for me, adding up details, just work, work, work, then you're done.

But are these efforts enough to protect kids' brains?\nConcussions can happen during many types of activities. But sports like football and soccer are especially risky. When you run or jump, your body is moving at an increased speed. A sudden hit causes you to move faster in a different direction.\n\"It's like when you're in a bus and it makes a sudden stop,\" says Dr. Kevin Crutchfield, an expert at a sports concussion center in Baltimore, Maryland. \"You hit the inside of the bus.\"\nThis hit damages the brain. It affects the way the brain functions. So some sports require athletes to wear helmets. Helmets help reduce the force of a hit. The hard outer shell spreads the force of larger area. Inside a helmet, a plastic or air-filled lining also helps soften the blow.\nSteve Rowson is an engineer at Virginia Tech. In his lab, he tests how helmets hold up against different types of hits. No helmet can prevent concussions completely, says Rowson. But he's found that when wearing a newer football helmet, the player's head doesn't gain speed as much after a hit. That lowers the risk of concussions.\nMany youth sports teams have set limits on physical contact to reduce the risk of concussions. In soccer, most concussions happen as a result of headers--shots or passes made with the head. That's why many people think kids shouldn't head the ball until high school.\nThese efforts should help, says Crutchfield. But the best way to prevent long-term brain injuries, he says, is to stop playing immediately if you suffer concussion. \"Protect yourself today so you can play again tomorrow.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Concussions among young players   _  . \n\nA. are rare before 2001\nB. seem extremely worrying\nC. cause kids to lose interest in sports\nD. are mostly caused by wearing no helmets\nAnswer = B\n\nThe author mentions the sudden stop of the bus to   _  . \n\nA. stress it's dangerous to ride buses\nB. show human brains are easily damaged\nC. give a better explanation of concussions\nD. remind people to wear helmets while playing sports\nAnswer = C\n\nWhat does Steve Rowson think of the newer football helmets? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"On October 19, 1959, the first Special English program was broadcast on the Voice of America. It was an experiment. The goal was to communicate by radio in clear and simple English with people whose native language is not English. Experts said the goal was admirable, but the method would not work. They were proved wrong. The Special English programs quickly became some of the most popular on VOA. And they still are.\nForty years later, Special English continues to communicate with people who are not fluent in English. But during the years its role has expanded. It also helps people learn American English. And it provides listeners, even those who are native English speakers, with information they cannot find elsewhere.\nToday, Special English broadcasts around the world seven days a week, five times a day. Each half-hour broadcast begins with ten minutes of the latest news followed by 20 minutes of feature programming. There is a different short feature every weekday about science, development, agriculture and environment, and on the weekend, about news events and American idioms.\nThree elements make Special English unique. It has a limited vocabulary of 1500 words. Most are simple words that describe objects, actions or emotions. Some are more difficult. They are used for reporting world events and describing discoveries in medicine and science. Special English is written in short, simple sentences that contain only one idea. No idioms are used. And Special English is spoken at a slower pace, about two-thirds the speed of Standard English. This helps people learning English hear each word clearly. It also helps people who are English speakers understand complex subjects.\nThrough the years, Special English has become a very popular tool for teaching English, even though it was not designed as teaching program. It succeeds in helping people learn English in a non-traditional way. Individuals record the programs and play them over and over to practice their listening skills. In countries around the world, English teachers assign Special English to their students. They praise it for improving their students' ability to understand American English and for the content of the programs. Universities and private companies in many countries produce packages of Special English materials for student use.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" At the beginning, Special English program was  _  . \n\nA. well received\nB. rejected by native people\nC. doubted by some professionals\nD. intended for teaching English\nAnswer = C\n\nWhat kind of English is spoken on Special English? \n\nA.

This year the world celebrates the 400thanniversary of Galileo's observations of the universe through an astronomical telescope  . In 1609, the Italian scientist first pointed a \"Dutch perspective glass\" at the night sky and made discoveries that changed mankind's conceptions of the universe. \nIn honor of Galileo's discoveries, the United Nations and the International Astronomical Union have declared 2009 to be the International Year of Astronomy (IYA 2009).\nIYA 2009 is a yearlong celebration of astronomy. Its goal is to spread knowledge of astronomy's contributions to society and culture and to inspire more interest in astronomy and science, especially among young people. The theme of the celebration is \"The Universe, Yours to Discover.\"\nOne interesting aim of the IYA is to encourage more diversity   in the field of astronomy and physics. IYA organizers hope that the yearlong celebration of astronomy will inspire more females and underrepresented minorities to pursue   careers in science. An event that will help further that goal is 100 Hours of Astronomy (100 HA) that will fall on April. This event aims to have as many people as possible look through a telescope. From April 2ndto 5th, millions of people worldwide will peer through telescopes to catch their first glimpse   of the universe, just as Galileo's did 400 years ago. Sidewalk astronomy events will give city-dwellers   an excellent opportunity to see the moon, the planet Saturn, and other objects in position for early evening observations. \nOrganizers hope that the activities of IYA will \"promote   a greater appreciation of the astronomy.\" So join the fun.

He decided to do something about the pothole problem in his city.\nChokwe developed the app with his friends Rodriguez Ratliff and Emmanuel Brooks. When the app detects a pothole, it is highlighted in red. And if you get close to the pothole, your phone will warn you with a beep. Drivers can also use the app to report any potholes and look for other routes they can take to avoid roads that have them.\nThe app relies on current available information about the streets of Jackson, already stored in a database of the city's 311 call system. Through the call system, citizens dial 3-1-1 to report non-emergency problems which include potholes. Chokwe and his friends determined that focusing on the 10 busiest streets in Jackson would give them a large enough sample size to test the prototype.\nWhile developing the app, the boys took part in a Minority Male Makers Program sponsored by Verizon and held at Jackson State University.

{"prompt":"A super drug that could remove Alzheimer's  ,heart disease and diabetes   and help people live to 100 is being developed by scientists. Their research is based on the identification of three genes that help prolong lives and prevent diseases which occur in old age. Medically controlling the proteins made by the \" longevity genes\" will allow millions to live longer, predicts Dr Nir Barzilai.\nThose whose DNA strongly features the three genes are 80 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's. The genes also fight against the deadly impact of smoking, poor diet, obesity and lack of exercise.\nAlready, several laboratories are working on a pill to imitate the benefits of the genes and Dr Barzilai thinks it could be tested within three years. The pill could remove some diseases that damage old age. \" The advantage of finding a gene that involves longevity is that we can develop a drug that will imitate exactly what this gene is doing,\" he said.\nOf the three longevity genes, two genes increase the production of so-called good cholesterol , which reduces the risk of heart disease. The third prevents diabetes. They were discovered by Dr Barzilai's team while studying the DNA of 500 Ashkenazi Jews with an average age of 100. The chances of living that long are one in 10,000 but the group, which shared relatively few common ancestors, was 20 times more likely to hit the entury. Dr Barzilai said: \" 30 percent of them were obese or overweight and 30 percent smoked two acks of cigarettes a day for more than 40 years, however they can live to 100.\"\nBut Andrew Ketteringham of the Alzheimer's Society said: \"Alzheimer's disease, a most common disease, is likely to be caused by a combination of genetic disosition , lifestyles and life events.

{"prompt":"Computers have been used in teaching for more than twenty years. But a new book says that only now are they changing education. And it predicts that a lot more is about to happen.\nThe book is called \"Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns.\" \"Disruptive Innovation\" is a theory developed by lead author Clayton Christensen, a professor at the prefix = st1 \/HarvardBusinessSchool. He says organizations almost always use new, creative technology only to continue what they already do.\nNew technology should change organizations, he says, and disrupt them in a good way. They should use the technology to do things differently--for example, to serve more needs. The book says the needed disruptive force in education is computer-based learning.\nMichael Horn, another author of \"Disrupting Class\", told us about a Bostonpublic that he visited. Every student at Lilla G. Frederick Middle School inDorchester,Massachusetts, has a laptop computer. One class was learning about storms. Michael Horn says the laptops made it possible to truly individualize the lessons, to divide materials by ability level and learning style. At the end of the class, the students all took part in a discussion led by the teacher.\nComputer-based learning offers a way for students to take advanced courses not offered at their school, or to retake classes they failed. It also serves those who cannot physically attend school, and students who receive home schooling.\nComputer-based learning includes online courses. Enrollments in online courses have grown sharply. In 2007, the United Stateshad about one million enrollments, not including college courses. Students could be enrolled in more than one course, through schools or education companies. High school students make up about seventy percent of the enrollment. Still, nationally, only about one percent of all high school courses last year were taught online.\nBut the authors of \"Disrupting Class\"predict it will be ten percent in about six years. And their research suggests that the number will be about fifty percent by 2019.

Because of this, the report says, e-waste is a growing problem in Lagos, Nigeria, and elsewhere in the developing world. Much of the waste ends up being thrown away along rivers and roads.

This low-tech recovery process could expose workers and the local environment to many dangerous materials used to build electronics.

She would scold her daughters if they failed to meet her expectations.\nMs. Chua had a clear list of what her daughters, Sophia and Louisa, were not permitted to do: \"Attend a sleepover, have a play date, watch TV or play computer games, be in a school play, get any grade less than an A.\" Many people criticize Amy Chua, saying her parenting methods were cruel and violent. She even admits that her husband, who is not Chinese, sometimes objected to her parenting style. But she says that is the way her parents raised her and her three sisters.\nMs. Chua says she eased some of the pressure after her younger daughter _ and shouted \"I hate my life! I hate you!\" But she also says American parents often have low expectations of their children's abilities. Amy Chua thinks one of the biggest differences between Western and Chinese parents is that Chinese parents take on strength rather than fragility.\"\nStacy DeBroff, who has written four books on parenting, says: \"Parents should rethink, what does it mean to be a successful parent and what does it mean to be a successful child?\" She says Amy Chua's parenting style is not limited to Chinese families. It represents a traditional way of parenting among immigrants seeking a better future for their children. But she also sees a risk. When children have no time to be social or to follow their own interests, they might not develop other skills that they need to succeed in life. Stacey DeBroff advises parents to develop their own style of parenting and not just repeat the way they were raised.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is mainly about   _  . \n\nA. how to teach children to learn music\nB. how to change the ways of parenting\nC.

{"prompt":"BEIJING -- The launch of a new manned space mission brings China closer to the establishment of a permanent space station, international experts say.\nChinese taikonauts, Jing Haipeng, 50, and Chen Dong, 37, were _ into space onboard Shenzhou-11 at 7:30 am Monday and will spend 30 days in the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2.The launch marks a key step toward China's plan to eventually operate a permanent space station. The successful launch of the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft is another step forward to put China among leading players in space technology, said Alexander Zheleznyakov, a Russian expert on history of space flights. China's experimental space lab will help provide solutions for spacecraft of different functions to approach and anchor, and for a long-term operation of life support system, said Zheleznyakov. Shenzhou-11 is scheduled to anchor on Wednesday with Tiangong-2, which is part of China's plan to build a permanent space station by 2022.\nChina can now test technologies for cargo spacecraft anchoring, life support system operation and water recycling to ensure a long-term continuous operation of its space station in the future with less dependence on renewal from the Earth, he said. If all goes well, China will launch the unpiloted Tianzhou-1 cargo ship next spring to autonomously tie up with Tiangong-2. Tianzhou-1 will be capable of automatically transferring rocket fuels, a vital requirement for space station grouping and maintenance, according to a report by Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS).\n\"That will further their anchoring abilities needed for the larger space station,\" Johnson Freese was quoted.\" Tiangong-2 is supposed to be able to stay in orbit for two years or longer, so that's taking them (Chinese) really close to 2019 or so.

The country carried out its first one-piloted space flight in October, 2003, making China the third country in the world to have independent human spaceflight ability after the Soviet Union and the United States. Then came another breakthrough on October 12, 2005, when Shenzhou 6, China's second human spaceflight, was launched, with a crew of two astronauts. What's more, the landmark spacewalk done by Zhai Zhigang, one of the three boarding Shenzhou 7, launched on Sept. 25, 2008, leads the country further in its space exploration.\nMeanwhile, China's moon exploration project, started in 2004, has also been progressing satisfactorily. Fifty years after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, China's first circumlunar satellite Chang'e 1 took off on Oct.24, 2007, which became another milestone  in China's space achievements after the above-mentioned manned flights. Chang'e 1 was expected to fulfill four scientific goals, one of which was to probe mineral elements on the moon, especially those not existent on Earth. It's said that the lunar regolith  is abundant in helium-3, a clean fuel that may support the Earth's energy demands for more than a century. Nearly 3 years later, Oct. 1, 2010 witnessed the blasting off of Chang'e 2, China's 2nd unmanned lunar probe, marking another step forward in moon exploration. This time the aim is to test the key techniques of Chang'e 3 and Chang'e 4, as a preparation for a soft lunar landing in the future.\nWith great expectations, people all over the world are looking forward to China's greater space achievements.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Altogether how many astronauts have made successful spaceflight by Shenzhou spaceship by now? \n\nA. 4\nB. 5\nC. 6\nD. 7\nAnswer = C\n\nAccording to the text, which of the following is TRUE? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"Today, as I was relaxing at the beach, I couldn't help but eavesdrop(,) on a conversation four high school kids were having on the beach blanket next to me. Their conversation was about making a positive difference in the world. And it went something like this...\n\"It's impossible to make a difference unless you're a huge company or someone with lots of money and power,\" one of them said.\n\"Yeah man,\" another replied. \"My mom keeps telling me to move mountains - to speak up and stand up for what I believe. But what I say and do doesn't even get noticed. I just keep answering to 'the man' and then I get slapped back  in place by him when I step out of line.\"\n\"Repression...\" another snickered.\nI smiled because I knew exactly how they felt. When I was their age, I was certain I was being repressed and couldn't possibly make a difference in this world. And I actually almost got fired from school once because I openly expressed how repressed  I felt in the middle of the principals' office.\nI Have A Dream.\nSuddenly, one of the kids noticed me eavesdropping and smiling. He sat up, looked at me and said, \"What? Do you disagree?\" Then as he waited for a response, the other three kids turned around too.\nRather than arguing with them, I took an old receipt out of my wallet , tore it into four pieces, and wrote a different word on each piece. Then I crumbled the pieces into little paper balls and handed a different piece to each one of them.\n\"Look at the word on the paper I just gave you and don't show it to anyone else.\" The kids looked at the single word I had handed each of them and appeared confused. \"You have two choices,\" I told them. \"If your word inspired you to make a difference in this world, then hold onto it. If not, give it back to me so I can recycle the paper.\" They all returned their words.\nI walked over quickly , sat down on the sand next to their beach blanket and laid out the four words that the students had returned to me so that the words combined to form the simple sentence,        \"I have a dream.\"\n\"Dude, that's Martin Luther King Jr.,\" one of the kids said.\n\"How did you know that?\" I asked.\n\"Everyone knows Martin Luther King Jr.\" the kid snarled. \"He has his own national holiday, and we all had to memorize his speech in school a few years ago.\"\n\"Why do you think your teachers had you memorize his speech?\" I asked.\n\"I don't really care!\" the kid replied. His three friends shook their heads in agreement. \"What does this have to do with us and our situation?\"\n\"Your teachers asked you to memorize those words, just like thousands of teachers around the world have asked students to memorize those words, because they have inspired millions of repressed people to dream of a better world and take action to make their dreams come true. Do you see where I'm going with this?\"\n\"Man, I know exactly what you're trying to do and it's not going to work, alright?\" the fourth kid said, who hadn't spoken a word until now. \"We're not going to get all inspired and emotional about something some dude said thirty years ago. Our world is different now. And it's more screwed up than any us can even begin to imagine, and there's little you or I can do about it. We're too small, we're nobody.\"\nTogether\nI smiled again because I once believed and used to say similar things. Then after holding the smile for a few seconds I said, \"On their own, 'I' or 'have' or 'a' or 'dream' are just words. Not very compelling or inspiring. But when you put them together in a certain order, they create a phrase that has been powerful enough to move millions of people to take action - action that changed laws, perceptions, and lives. You don't need to be inspired or emotional to agree with this, do you?\"\nThe four kids shrugged and struggled to appear totally indifferent, but I could tell they were listening intently. \"And what's true for words is also true for people,\" I continued. \"One person without help from anyone else can't do much to make a big difference in this crazy world - or to overcome all of the various forms of repression that exist today. But when people get together and unite to form something more powerful and meaningful then themselves, the possibilities are endless.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Why were the kids repressed? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"For many years there's been a debate about rewarding our children. Does it work? Is it effective?\nSome people think we should establish a standard with our kids and give them something for meeting this standard as a reward. Punishment is given out in much the same way, but it's used when certain standards of performance, behavior, etc. have not been met. Kids will often become more dutiful when threatened with punishment, and work harder when promised a valuable reward. The problem is what happens when you aren't around.\nTo develop responsible, self-disciplined   kids, parents need to promote certain ideas. One of these ideas is that everyone pitches in   and helps in your family, even if someone is not crazy about helping. Another idea is that there can be enjoyment in doing any task if we choose to make it so. When a task is for a worthy cause (our family can enjoy the house more because I have helped clean it), and when parents are cheerful about their chores, this message can have a big impact.\nThis is how we help our kids develop a sense of responsibility. When our children develop this responsibility, they'll be more disciplined, and they'll control their emotions better. When we give rewards to our kids, we reduce the sense of responsibility. We also create children who may temporarily perform to a certain standard, but who aren't likely to continue the performance without the carrot hanging in front of them.\n\"Rewards and punishment can change behavior for a while, but they cannot change the person who engages in the behavior, at least in the way we want,\" said Alfie Kohn, author of Punished by Rewards. \"Good values have to be grown from the inside out.\" Parents can help give their children a sense of shared responsibility and discipline which can last a lifetime. The real rewards that your children receive will be their readiness for the complex and demanding world that waits for them-- a world that rewards those who have learned the secrets of discipline and responsibility. So keep those shiny rewarding to yourself, and  _ .\n\n###\n\n","completion":" According to the passage, when children are threatened with punishment,_. \n\nA. they may lose interest in their work\nB. they may appear to be well-behaved\nC. they may change to another person\nD. the results will be worse than usual\nAnswer = B\n\nWhich of the following sentences can be used to end this passage? \n\nA. let your kids find their own rewards\nB. allow your kids to enjoy their punishment\nC. prevent your kids from failing\nD. persuade your kids into accepting who they are\nAnswer = A\n\nAccording to the passage, Alfie Kohn would agree that parents should_. \n\nA. pay no attention to the way their children do things\nB. never punish their children\nC. show their children how to behave by example\nD. help their children establish good values\nAnswer = D\n\nWhat's the best title for the passage? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"Allen: I've never been in big fan of the bears, especially the vacation show. On my last trip to Disneyland (1999) we passed it by, because we didn't want to spend the time on something we didn't really enjoy. If we'd known it would be closed by our next visit, I'm sure we would have watched it one more time. I was just making the point that it wasn't until Disney announced the closing that this feeling suddenly sprang  up for the Country Bear Show at Disneyland. But I think the idea of keeping some attractions open forever regardless of the number of visitors it gets is a mistake. We all have great memories of the Bears, but clearly very few kids today (or I should say families today) are making those same memories from this show. That may be a sad fact, but it's a fact. Isn't it right to use the Country Bear space to bring in a more popular attraction so that more kids today can make those magic memories of an attraction they like? Otherwise aren't we just telling kids today that they \"have to\" make great memories of the Bears, when it's obvious that the kids themselves are not enjoying the Bears like we did?\nRoger: I am very disappointed that they have decided to retire the Country Bear Playhouse. I remember going to the show as a child, and still enjoyed it as a teenager, and now young adult. It is true that there aren't a lot of shows left at DL and with this one closing even less. Being at DL does require a lot of walking, and it is nice to have a few attractions that are a place to sit and enjoy a good show. I understand that DL has to develop, but there has to be some history to the Disneyland that Walt Disney first designed. There should be some parts of DL that just never go away, and this is one of them. By the time I have children it looks like there won't be any attractions that I can say I went to as a child at the rate they are going.\nNow the Bears are leaving, What I want to say is: stop trying to compete with everyone!

{"prompt":"Many independent Chinese women like to earn their own bread, even if their husbands are already bringing home the bacon. But a recent survey suggests that such women find more joy from relationships, rather than successful careers.\nAbout 73 percent of the 7,000 women surveyed in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou said they would choose to work even if their husbands earned enough for the family. The survey also found that 77 percent define happiness as \"enjoying a relationship\".\nBut striking a balance between career and family can bring challenges to the woman's career advancement.\n\"In my company, women usually have an equal or even a higher starting salary than men,\" said Li Hua, general manager of Beijing Chuangjiashe Book Circulation Company. \"However, as they begin to climb up the career ladder, women often meet problems along the way, while men can climb the ladder more easily.\"\nBoth physical and emotional differences can prevent some women from taking tough positions, Li said. But family life is often the main difficulty for Chinese career women.\nDespite these challenges, however, some experts believe it's reasonable for some women to want to be breadwinners.\n\"In this way, the roles of a family are decided by the parents' abilities rather than their gender ,\" said Gu Donghui, a sociology professor at Fudan University.\nGu says women should have the freedom to decide if they want to stay at home or work to support the family. \"Everyone has a different interpretation of what it means to find self-worth\".\nWang Haibin, an economic expert from Renmin University shares that view: \"Traditionally, we tend to regard the family as the cell unit of society.

{"prompt":"Chinese female film stars, like Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi, due to the charm of their films, have set a good image for Chinese women in the world. Compared with Chinese women, the image of Chinese men is not so good in the eyes of Western women, the Shanghai Evening Post reported.\nIn March 2006, Zhang Jiehai, a doctorate  holder at the Sociology Institute of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, led a research team to investigate how Western women look at Chinese men. The survey shows that many Western women think Chinese men are mostly known for their care for the family. Chinese men, as the Western women say, are willing to spend money for women. As to their shortcomings, Western women think that Chinese men do not have good manners and that some Chinese men have the habit of spitting everywhere, keeping nails and hair long, picking their noses and ears in public places, and not cleaning their teeth thoroughly. These bad habits make many Western women think that Chinese men are unwilling to take care of their personal image.\nThe survey was carried out in two ways, by questionnaires and interviews. All the respondents  agreed that Chinese men show much tender loving care for the family and that many Chinese men do know how to respect women. They open the door for women and carry their handbags for them. For some American women, the bad image of Chinese men in the world is largely because of Hollywood films. In many Hollywood films, Chinese men usually do not have a good image. But this has been changed by Hong Kong film star Chow Yun-Fat. After the Chinese filmCrouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon was shown in cinemas in the United States in 2002, many Westerners began to change their impression of Chinese men.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In some American women's eyes, Chinese men's images are bad because of   _  . \n\nA.

{"prompt":"Since the nineteen nineties, education has been required for all South Africans from age seven to fifteen. Last December, the government announced that seventy percent of students passed their final examination to finish high school. In 2008 the passage rate was about sixty-three percent. There have been increases each year since then.\nProfessor Shireen Motala at the University of Johannesburg says access to basic education is no longer the problem in South Africa. She says most children stay in school until they are about sixteen. The problem now, she says, is that large numbers of them leave without completing high school.\nStudents take an examination known as the matric in grade twelve, their final or \"matriculation\" year. Professor Motala notes that less than half the children who started school in 2000 sat for the matric last year. He said, \"Only around forty-five percent survived, which means that a large number of children are falling by the wayside. And the concern is that where do those learners actually go to.\"\nEducational researchers also point to another problem. They say South African schools do not produce enough students with the skills for higher education in math and science.\nOne of those researchers is Graeme Bloch. He says many schools are not well-equipped. \"Because of poverty and limited resources, many children do not see laboratories and ninety-two percent of the schools do not have libraries.\"\nAlso, education specialists say in many cases, teachers and school principals do not have the skills or training to do their jobs. In other cases, they are simply not doing their duty to provide an education.\nProfessor Motala says a number of teachers were poorly trained during the system of apartheid, or racial separation in South Africa. Apartheid ended in 1994. Secondly, she says, teachers have been confused by the many educational reform efforts in the last fifteen years. And, finally, she thinks language differences in the classroom have not gotten as much attention as they should. Subjects such as math and science are taught in English starting at about age ten. But South Africa has eleven official languages and many more unofficial ones.\nSouth Africa's minister of basic education promises a number of improvements. Angie Motshega says teacher development efforts will focus on subject and content knowledge, and making sure the correct teachers are in the correct jobs.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Which of the following statements is WRONG? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"Doreen Sykora is now a junior at McGill University. She had a difficult time when she first began college. She said, \"I was always well prepared for my examinations. But when I go into class to take the exam, I would fall apart. I could just _ because of nervousness and fear.\" Hitoshi Sakamoto, an anthropology  student at Temple University in Tokyo reports similar experiences.\nThese two young students were experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is stressed  about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the severe tension and nervousness.\nNow there are special university courses to help students. In these courses, advisors and psychologists try to help students by teaching them to manage test anxiety. Such a course helps students learn to live with stress and not fail because of it. First students take a practice test to measure their worry level. If the tests show that their stress level is high, the students can take a short course to manage the fear. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. They get training to become calm in very tense situations. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work more easily. Learned information then comes out without difficulty on a test.\nDoreen Sykora saw immediate results after taking such a course. She now has enthusiasm about the relaxation methods. \"Mostly, what I do is imagine myself in a very calm place. Then I imagine myself picking up a pencil. I move slowly and carefully. I breathe easily and let all the tension out. With each breath, more worry leaves me. It really works too. My grades have improved greatly! I'm really doing well at McGill now.

{"prompt":"Surprisingly, no one knows how many children receive education in English hospitals, still less the content or quality of that education. Proper records are just not kept. We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital.\nLittle wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games.\nReasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as \"the library lady\" or just \"the helper\". Children tend to rely on concerned school friends to keep in touch with school work. Several parents spoke of requests for work being ignored or refused by the school. Once back at school children rarely get extra teaching, and are told to catch up as best they can.\nMany short-stay child-patients catch up quickly. But schools do very little to ease the anxiety about falling behind expressed by many of the children interviewed.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Which of the following statements is true? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"Getting kids to share their toys is a never-ending battle, and forcing them to do so never seems to help. New research suggests that allowing children to make a choice to sacrifice their own toys in order to share with someone else makes them share more in the future. The new findings are published inPsychological Science.\nThese experiments were conducted by psychological scientists, Nadia Chernyak and Tamar Kushnir of Cornell University. They found that sharing things with others when they are given a difficult choice leads children to think of themselves as people who like to share. It also makes them more likely to act in a pro-social  manner in the future.\nPrevious research has explained why rewarding children for sharing can _ . Children come to think of themselves as people who don't like to share since they had to be rewarded for doing so. Because they don't view themselves as \"sharers\", they are less likely to share in the future.\nChernyak and Kushnir were interested in finding out whether freely chosen sacrifice might have the opposite effect on kids' willingness to share. To test this, the researchers introduced five-year-old children to Doggie, a sad puppet. Some of the children were given a difficult choice: Share a precious sticker  with Doggie, or keep it for themselves. Other children were given an easy choice between sharing and putting the sticker away, while children in a third group were required by the researcher to share.\nLater on, all the children were introduced to Ellie, another sad puppet. They were given the option of how many stickers to share (up to three). The kids who earlier made the difficult choice to help Doggie shared more stickers with Ellie. The children who were initially faced with an easy choice or who were required to give their sticker to Doggie, on the other hand, shared fewer stickers with Ellie. Therefore, children did not benefit from simply giving something up, but rather from willingly choosing to give something up of value.\n\"You might imagine that making difficult, costly choices is demanding for young children or even that once children share, they don't feel the need to do so again,\" Chernyak says. \"But this wasn't the case: once children made a difficult decision to give up something for someone else, they were more generous, not less, later on.\" Chernyak concludes.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" _   helps children to share more in the future. \n\nA.

{"prompt":"You may have heard about the many benefits of yoga, but a recent New York Times story, has stirred up more than a little controversy in the yoga community.\n\"How Yoga Can _ Your Body,\" by science writer William J. Broad, quotes a long-time yoga teacher who \"...has come to believe that 'the vast majority of people' should give up yoga altogether. It's simply too likely to cause harm.\" He goes on to describe a number of cases where people have been injured doing yoga, including himself.\nThe research in the article isn't groundbreaking: doing any form of exercise you could potentially hurt yourself. If you look at the injury rates of other physical activities, the number of injuries sustained from yoga would pale in comparison.\nPracticing yoga is just like anything in life: You have to push yourself in order to grow. But you also have to know your limits and when you're breaking them. If you stick to your comfort zone, you'll never be able to increase your flexibility. If you push to the point where you're not only uncomfortable, but in real pain, you'll likely injure yourself.\nThe reasons that yoga causes \"serious injury\", according to the Times story, range from students' physical weaknesses to inexperienced teachers pushing too hard to the growing number of inflexible \"urbanites who sit in chairs all day\" trying hard to twist themselves into difficult postures.\nYoga is called a \"practice\" for a reason. You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to tackle every pose. It doesn't matter if you can touch the floor with your palms during your first forward bend or your thousandth, or if you never get there.\nWe go to the mat to learn to better listen to what our bodies are telling us, and to better hear that quiet inner voice drowned out by the noise of our busy lives. It's a shame to discourage the majority of people from practicing yoga and missing out on all of the mind-body benefits that going to the mat has to offer.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Which is not mentioned among the reasons for yoga being likely to cause injury? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"We've been judging people based on the way they look for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks turned it into a science, \"physiognomy\". As early as 500 BC, the mathematician Pythagoras would look carefully at young men's faces to determine if they'd make a good student, not long after Aristotle wrote how large-headed people were mean. It was widely believed at the time that the animal a person resembled was a good judge of character.\nBy the Middle Ages it was well and truly mainstream. Professionals coined the phrase \"stuck-up\" to refer from the belief that those with upturned noses had an air of superiority, \"high-brow\" to refer to the high foreheads of nobles and \"low-brow\" to the less educated foreheads of the lower classes.\nBack in 2016, we're still doing it. We view those who resemble Labradors   as warm, while those who resemble lions as more of a ruler. We think of those with \"resting moody face\" as more aggressive, those who are less attractive as sick and expect people who look familiar to share our values. Many of these judgments occur in as little as 50 milliseconds.\nTo get to understand and find out why having a babyface is so great, first we need to know what happens when we recognize an actual baby.\nIn fact, the features of babies and those universally considered \"cute\" are nothing more than a series of developmental accidents. Our eyes are already fully grown by the time we're born but our heads aren't. Similarly, our bodies do a lot more growing later on than our heads. Babies have more body fat than adults, chubby  cheeks, for example. The list goes on.\nAnd regardless of whether you're very maternal   or find babies really annoying, we're unconditionally to respond to their features by turning into gentle baby-talking fools. Most importantly, gazing into their innocent faces makes us less aggressive and more generous and helpful.\nSo there you have it. Next time you find yourself staring affectionately into the eyes of a baby-faced friend, colleague or date, just remember, you may be the latest victim in a long-running systematic evolutionary trick.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What's the passage mainly talking about? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"The latest research suggests that the key factor separating geniuses from the merely accomplished is not I.Q., a generally bad predictor of success. Instead, it's purposeful practice. Top performers spend more hours practising their craft. If you wanted to picture how a typical genius might develop, you'd take a girl who possessed a slightly above average language ability. It wouldn't have to be a big talent, just enough so that she might gain some sense of distinction. Then you would want her to meet, say, a novelist, who coincidentally shared some similar qualities. Maybe the writer was from the same town, had the same family background, or shared the same birthday. \nThis contact would give the girl a vision of her future self. It would give her some idea of a fascinating circle who might someday join. It would also help if one of her parents died when she was 12, giving her a strong sense of insecurity and fuelling a desperate need for success. Armed with this ambition, she would read novels and life stories of writers without end. This would give her a primary knowledge of her field. She would be able to see new writing in deeper ways and quickly understand its inner workings. \nThen she would practise writing. Her practice would be slow, painstaking and error-focused. By practising in this way, she delays the automating process. Her mind wants to turn conscious, newly learned skills into unconscious, automatically performed skills. By practising slowly, by breaking skills down into tiny parts and repeating, she forces the brain to internalize a better pattern of performance. Then she would find an adviser who would provide a constant stream of feedback, viewing her performance form the outside, correcting the smallest errors, pushing her to take on tougher challenges. By now she is redoing problems--how do I get characters into a room--dozens and dozens of times. She is establishing habits of thought she can call upon in order to understand or solve future problems. \nThe primary quality our young writer possesses is not some mysterious genius. It's the ability to develop a purposeful, laborious and boring practice routine; the latest research takes some of the magic out of great achievement.

{"prompt":"Chinese netizens who like to create and use cyber words such as \"geilivable\" might find a new regulation very \"ungeilivable\". The new regulation by the General Administration of Press and Publication last week banned the use of Chinglish words created by netizens for publishing in the Chinese language.\n\"Geilivable\", combining the pinyin geili(giving strength) with the English suffix   for adjectives, literally means \"giving power\" or \"cool\". Different suffixes( ) and prefixes were then added to the word. \"Hengeilivable\" means \"very cool\", and \"ungeilivable\" means \"dull, not cool at all\".\nCyber language is popular among Chinese netizens, who create Chinglish words to reflect phenomenon in society. One example is \"antizen\", which refers to college graduates who earn a  _ salary and live in small rented apartments, like tiny and laborious ants.\nDavid Tool, a professor with the Beijing International Studies University, said it's very interesting to combine Chinese with English to create new words. \"English is no longer mysterious to the Chinese people. They can use the language in a flexible way according to their own experiences,\" Tool said.\nAt the announcement of the regulation by the General Administration of Press and Publication, netizens expressed their concern. \n\"The administration is totally 'ungeilivable',\" said a netizen named laoda1713. \"I know other netizens will shed tears with me... it is a good chance to enrich our language\".\n\"Language is always developing,\" said a columnist, Wang Pei. \"It needs to be updated to absorb foreign culture and folk wisdom.\"\nBut an unnamed official with the administration said that, in fact, many senior staff from news media who supported the regulation were worried that years later, the younger generation would forget how to use formal Chinese expressions.

{"prompt":"Negative self talk and negative energy can affect you in many ways and cause you additional stress. Because of this, developing more positive self talk is an important way to reduce stress in your life. You can help yourself maintain a positive frame of mind which will help with positive self talkby surrounding yourself with positive energy in your life. You can get that by adding some elements to your life.\nListening to music that not only has a pleasant melody, but an uplifting message, can be great for developing positive self talk. Have you ever had a song \"stuck in your head\" for a few hours or days, the lyrics   repeating themselves in your mind? If those lyrics were positive and inspirational, that would be a good thing. It's a much better mental soundtrack to have than a running stream of complaints, criticisms of self-limiting thoughts, or even songs that had more depressing or sad lyrics.\nBooks on strength, personal power, enlightenment, or self help can be good resources to help you change your outlook and the things you say to yourself. Rather than bringing habitual self-defeating thoughts, you can find yourself thinking of new can-do concepts when times get tough.\nOne of the most important ways you can get and keep positive energy in your life is with the company you keep. Do your friends uplift you, or bring you down? Are they critical, or approving? Ideal friendships provide support when you're down, fun when you're up, wisdom when you're lost. Good friends can inspire you to reach greater heights, and see your strengths even when you don't always. Pay attention to how your friends make you feel, and if they're less than supportive, start putting your energy and time toward people who are better suited to be your friends.\nIn addition, positive affirmations  can certainly change your self talk from negative to positive. Now, why not begin working positive affirmations into your life in some creative ways?\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What does the passage mainly talk about? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"Moral science is taught as a subject in most schools but with little effect. Perhaps part of the problem lies in the fact that morality is not a science, strictly speaking. It is too much of a social phenomenon, and also has too much of the personal and subjective things mixed within. Besides, morality itself changes with generations. So it is impossible to be defined in a textbook.\nI remember sitting through forty minutes of moral lessons, which told stories about little children who never told lies and were rewarded for their goodness. It had little effect and left no impression on me, though.\nIf moral science has to be taught as a subject in schools, it needs a participatory  approach. When you tell a child about morals, you also have to deal with social norms and cultural differences. You have to explain that morality can be subjective, and be able to co-exist in society. You will probably have to refer to the morals of the present time.\nThe best way to tell a child how to live is to show him what is valued. If a child likes his friend, you have to make the child think about why. Once the child notices and recognizes goodness in others, he or she is likely to develop it as well.\nIn fact, children learn most of their morals by watching people around them. They absorb behavior patterns from teachers and older students. They watch to see what is rewarded and who is punished. They learn on the sports field and through social work. Moral science lessons should simply consist of letting them live and interact, and watch you support correct values and reward good behavior.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Which is NOT the reason that moral science is taught in schools but with little effect? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"Pete Richards was the loneliest man in town on the day that little Jean Grace opened the door of his shop.\nPete's grandfather had owned the shop until his death. Then the shop became Pete's. The front window was full of beautiful old things: jewelry of a hundred years ago, gold and silver boxes, carved figures from China and Japan and other nations.\nOn this winter afternoon, a child stood there, her face close to the window. With large and serious eyes, she studied each piece in the window. Then, looking pleased, she stepped back from the window and went into the shop. Pete himself stood behind the counter. His eyes were cold as he looked at the small girl. \"Please,\" she began, \"would you let me look at the pretty string of blue beads in the window?\" Pete took the string of blue beads from the window. The beads were beautiful against his hand as he held the necklace up for her to see.\n\"They are just right,\" said the child as though she were alone with the beads. \"Will you wrap them up in pretty paper for me, please? I've been looking for a really wonderful Christmas present for my sister.\"\n\"How much money do you have?\" asked Pete.\nShe put a handful of pennies on the counter. \"This is all I have,\" she explained simply. \"I've been saving the money for my sister's present.\"\nPete looked at her, his eyes thoughtful. Then he carefully closed his hand over the price mark on the necklace so that she could not see it. How could he tell her the price? The happy look in her big blue eyes struck him like the pain of an old wound.\n\"Just a minute,\" he said and went to the back of the shop. \"What's your name?\" he called out. He was very busy about something.\n\"Jean Grace,\" answered the child.\nWhen Pete returned to the front of the shop, he held a package in his hand. It was wrapped in pretty Christmas paper.\n\"There you are,\" he said. \"Don't lose it on the way home.\"\nShe smiled happily at him as she ran out of the door. Through the window he watched her go. He felt more alone than ever.\nSomething about Jean Grace and her string of beads had made him feel once more the pain of his old grief. The child's hair was as yellow as the sunlight; her eyes were as blue as the sea. Once upon a time, Pete had loved a girl with hair of that same yellow and with eyes just as blue. And the necklace of blue stones had been meant for her.\nBut one rainy night, a car had gone off the road and struck the girl. After she died, Pete felt that he had nothing left in the world except his grief. The blue eyes of Jean Grace brought him out of that world of self-pity and made him remember again all that he had lost. The pain of remembering was so great that Pete wanted to run away from the happy Christmas shoppers who came to look at his beautiful old things during the next ten days.\nWhen the last shopper had gone, late on Christmas Eve, the door opened and a young woman came in. Pete could not understand it, but he felt that he had seen her before. Her hair was sunlight yellow and her eyes were sea-blue. Without speaking, she put on the counter a package wrapped in pretty Christmas paper. When Pete opened the package, the string of blue beads lay again before him.\n\"Did this come from your shop?\" she asked.\nPete looked at her with eyes no longer cold. \"Yes, it did,\" he said.\n\"Are the stones real?\"\n\"Yes. They aren't the best turquoise , but they are real.\"\n\"Can you remember to whom you sold them?\"\n\"She was a small girl. Her name was Jean.

How could she pay for them?\"\n\"\n\" he said.\nFor a moment there was no sound in the little shop. Then somewhere in the city, church bells began to ring. It was midnight and the beginning of another Christmas Day.\n\"But why did you do it?\" the girl asked.\nPete put the package into her hands.\n\"There is no one else to whom I can give a Christmas present,\" he said. \"It is already Christmas morning. Will you let me take you to your home?

{"prompt":"I have heard having a good sense of humour often helps in breaking the ice. Also people remember you because of your humour. But I think I don't have a very good sense of humour. Could you suggest how to build on this?\n----Radha Karnik\nThis is a great question that is unfortunately difficult to answer. I can only give you my views on this topic, which may or may not be correct. I know that my sense of humour developed over time.\nWhen I was younger I was not funny at all, now I can easily make people laugh. At the same time, sometimes I say things that I think are very funny but others do not. Improving wit and humour, I believe, is an ongoing process.\nNow, there are various forms of humour and everyone has their individual style. Overall, I believe being fluent in a language is very important for being witty or funny. The way we play around with words adds the \"funny\" tag to an otherwise normal sentence.\nAlso, seeing irony is very important. I think humour is often the link between two unrelated things.\nIn my experience, laughing frequently and appreciating other people's jokes and wit are very important. Within these, finding humour in everyday normal situations is the key.\nI often notice what is going on around me and say funny things in my head and laugh to myself. That serves almost as practice for when I am in a group.

{"prompt":"People used to think that wetlands were wasted land. Developers would drain them with ditches ,fill them in with tons of soil,and build houses,schools,and parking areas on them.Then scientists began to realize the important role wetlands played in the environment.\nWetlands act like giant sponges  during storms.They soak up extra storm water and afterward release it slowly back into the water cycle.This helps prevent flooding. Towns where people have drained wetlands have found that in a big storm,their streets and homes are often flooded because there are no wetlands to soak up the excess water.\nWetlands also act as giant filters where pollutants are absorbed and dissolved over time.Though wetlands can become polluted from dumping,wastewater,and fertilizer runoff from farm fields,they are able to process some pollutants over time because of all the microorganisms and plants living there.\nWetlands are especially important for providing homes and breeding grounds to millions of birds,fish,and amphibians worldwide. Many wetlands have become national wildlife refuges ,where you can go to take pictures and look at birds and animals.\nThe Everglades are a huge wetland that once covered more than four million acres of southern Florida. Sometimes called the \"river of grass\",the Everglades are a shallow sheet of water that slowly flowed across a grassy plain. In the late 1800s people began draining parts of the Everglades for development. Roads were built and towns sprang up.The Everglades shrank to half its original size. Cities like Miami grew up where once there was a thriving wetland. Sewage and waste from the cities were pumped into the remaining wetlands. Over time scientists began to see the importance of the Everglades. Even with its smaller size,the Everglades filtered the pollutants coming from the cities,absorbing the worst of it like a sewage treatment plant. During storms the Everglades protected the cities from storm surge flooding. They also are just a great place to visit and see wildlife.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Why can wetlands be compared to giant sponges? \n\nA. They absorb extra water from storms.\nB.

{"prompt":"Baby girls make their way directly for dolls as soon as they can crawl, while boys will head for cars, a study has shown. The findings, the first to show differences in very young babies, suggest there is a biological basis to their preferences.\nPsychologists Dr Brenda Todd from City University London carried out an experiment involving 90 babies aged 9 months to 36 months. The babies were allowed to choose from seven toys. Some were typically boys' toys ---- a car, a digger, a ball and a blue teddy. The rest were girls' toys: a pink teddy, a doll and a cooking set. They were placed a meter away from the toys;and could pick whichever toy they liked their choice and the amount of time they spent playing with each toy were recorded.\nOf the youngest children (9 to 14 months), girls spent significantly longer playing with the doll than boys, and boys spent much more time with the car and ball than the girls did. Among the two and three-year-olds, girls spent 50 percent of the time playing with the doll while only two boys briefly touched it. The boys spent almost 90 percent of their time playing with cars, which the girls barely touched. There was no link between the parents' view on which toys were more appropriate for boys or girls, and the children's choice.\nDr Brenda Todd said, \"Children of this age are already exposed to much socialization. Boys may be given 'toys that go' while girls get toys they can care for, which may help shape their preference. But these findings agree with the former idea that children show natural interests in particular kinds of toys. There could be a biological basis for their choices.

{"prompt":"Decision-making can be extremely difficult. Decision-making styles are significantly different in different cultures.\nIn any approach to a problem and in any negotiations, the Western world turns to the\"I to you\" approach while Japan,the \"you to you\" approach. The former means both sides present their arguments openly from their own point of view. Naturally, often comes a conflict situation, which Westerners are very skillful in dealing with.The latter is based on each side trying to understand the other person's point of view. Thus, the direction of the meeting is a mutual  attempt to reduce confrontation and achieve harmony.\nBesides, Western decision-making goes mostly from top management and often does not consult middle management or the worker. However, in Japan great consideration is given to the thoughts and opinions of everyone at all levels. Based on \"bottom-up direction\", ideas can be created at the lowest levels, travel upward through an organization and have an effect on the final decision.\nDifference in decision-making also comes from different communication styles. The Japanese business person works to achieve harmony, even if the deal fallsthrough, and will spend whatever time is necessary to determine a \"you to you\" approach, communicating personal views only indirectly. They put a thorough job above the Western deadline approach. So the Japanese are thorough in their meetings. Thus Americans are often annoyed by the many meetings in many Japanese businesses. But where the American is pressingfor a specific decision, the Japanese is trying to think up a rather broad direction.\nOn the other hand, once a given agreement is made, it is the Japanese who sometimes wonderat the slow pace in which Westerners carry out the decision.

{"prompt":"Seventeenth-century houses in colonial North American were simple structures that were primarily functional, carrying over traditional designs that went back to the Middle Ages.  During the first half of the eighteen century, however, houses began to show a new elegance.  As wealth increased, more and more colonist built fine houses.\n   Since architecture was not yet a specialized profession in the colonies, the design of buildings was left either to amateur   designers or to carpenters who were engaged in translating architectural handbooks imported from England.  Inventories of libraries shows an astonishing number of these handbooks for builders, and the houses built during the eighteenth century show their influence.  Nevertheless, most household architecture of the first-quarters of the eighteenth century displays a wide  _ of taste and freedom of application of the rules laid down in these books.\n   Increasing wealth and growing sophistication   throughout the colonies resulted in houses of improved design, whether the material was wood, stone, or brick.  New England still favored wood, though brick houses became common in Boston and other towns, where the danger of fire gave an impetus   to the use of more durable material.  A few houses in New England were built of stone, but only in Pennsylvania and areas nearby was stone widely used in buildings.  An increased use of brick in houses and outbuildings is noticeable in Virginia and Maryland, but wood remained the most popular material even in houses built by wealthy landowners.  In the Carolinas, even in closely packed Charleston, wooden houses were much common than brick houses.\n   Eighteenth-century houses showed great interior improvements over the former ones.  Windows were made larger and shutters removed.  Large, clear panes replaced the small leaded glass of the seventeenth century.  Doorways were larger and more decorative.\n   Fireplaces became decorative features of rooms.  Walls were made of plaster or wood.  White paint began to take the place of blues, yellows, greens, and lead color1s, which had been popular for walls in the earlier years.

Linguists   celebrated his 250th birthday on October 16. After the Revolutionary War (1775~ 1783),Webster believed that Americans should have their own dictionary,rather than rely on British versions  . He dropped the British \"u\" in some words.

In defining   preposterous (unreasonable),he wrote: \"A republican government in the hands of females is preposterous.\"\nWebster spent 28 years on the project before completing the 70,000-word dictionary in 1828 with his American-style spellings. He also added local words. His dictionary was widely used in schools.

The boy looked around and said, \"We're losing by six runs   and the game is in the eighth inning  .I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the final inning.\nShay struggled over to the team's bench and put on a team shirt with a broad smile and his father had a small tear in his eye and warmth in heart.

Perhaps alcoholism and drug addiction really are \"diseases. \" as many people say, but my own feeling-based, of course, not on any serious study-is that most alcoholies and drug addicts belong to the \"undeserving poor. \" And that is largely why I don't give spare change to beggars.\nBut surely among the street people there are also some who can rightly be called \"deserving.\" Deserving what? My spare change? Or simply the government's assistance? It happens that I have been brought up to believe that it is proper to make contributions to charity , but if I give some change to a beggar, am I making a contribution to charity and thereby helping someone, or, am I perhaps simply encouraging someone not to get help? Or, maybe even worse, am I supporting a cheat?\nIf one believes in the value of private charity, one can either give to needy people or to charitable organizations. In giving to a beggar one may indeed be helping a person who badly needs help, but one cannot be certain that one is giving to a needy person. In giving to an organization, on the other hand, one can feel that one's money is likely to beused wisely. True, facing a beggar one may feel thatthis particular unfortunateperson needs help atthis moment-a cup of coffee or a sandwich-and the need will not be met unless I put my hand in my pocket right now. But I have come to think that the beggars whom I meet can get along without my spare change, and indeed perhaps they are actually better off for not having money to buy alcohol or drugs.\nI know nothing about these beggars, but it's my impression that they simply prefer begging to working.

{"prompt":"Everybody hates it, but everybody does it. A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a $16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip.\nBut according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service.\nTipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food $2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping.\nAccording to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval.

She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way.\n    The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero.\nAlthough most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. \"They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,\" she said.\" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners.\" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. \"The question,\" said Ms Darker Smith, \"is why she did not break the door down herself.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The passage is especially intended for   _  . \n\nA. parents with young daughters\nB. girls who like reading fairy stories\nC. girls who think they can change their partners\nD. parents with grown-up daughters\nAnswer = A\n\nCinderella, Rapunzel and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast are similar in that   _  . \n\nA.

{"prompt":"The ocean bottom, a region nearly 2.5 times greater than the total land area of the earth, is even today largely unexplored. Until about a century ago, the deep ocean floor was completely inaccessible and hidden beneath waters averaging over 3,600 meters deep. Totally without light and in the case of intense pressures hundreds of times greater than at the earth's surface, the deep-ocean bottom is a strange environment to humans, in some way as frightening and remote as the outer space.\nAlthough researchers have taken samples of deep-ocean rocks for over a century, the first detailed global study of the ocean bottom did not actually start until 1969, with the beginning of the National Science Foundation's Deep Sea Drilling Project(DSDP). Using techniques first developed for the offshore oil and gas industry, the DSDP's drill ship, the Glomar Challenger, was able to maintain a steady position on the ocean's surface and drill very deep waters, taking samples of rocks from the ocean floor.\nThe Glomar Challenger completed 96 voyages in a 15-year research program that ended in November 1983. During this time, it sailed 600,000 kilometers and took almost 20,000 samples of rocks around the world. Those samples have allowed geologists to reconstruct what the planet looked like hundreds of millions of years ago and to make out what it will probably look like millions of years in the future. Today, largely on the strength of evidence gathered during the Glomar Challenger's voyages, nearly all earth scientists agree on the theories of plate tectonics   and continental drift that explain many of the geological processes.\nThe sample of rocks drilled by the Glomar Challenger have also provided a climatic record stretching back hundreds of millions of years. The information of past climatic change can be used to predict the future climate.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Which of the following is TRUE about the Glomar Challenger? \n\nA.

He smiled to himself at the thought that someone would dance on the beach.

{"prompt":"Security--for the information on your smartphone, as well as for the phone itself---is a hot topic these days. The truth is that you're packing a lot of sensitive information on your phone, and you should keep it safe.\nWhen it comes to physical security, iPhone users would do well to download Find My iPhone, a free app from Apple that allows you to visit a website and see your (lost, stolen or misplaced) phone on the map. You can then sound an alarm, send a message that will pop up on its screen, lock the phone or erase all your data.\nAndroid does not have an exact equivalent , but there are plenty of alternatives. A free app called Lookout offers the find-my-phone feature. The paid version allows you to wipe the data from your phone remotely.\nThen there is your coffee shop's WiFi network. Anyone with minimal technical expert skill can snoop on  people using shared wireless networks, harvesting passwords and other personal data. Lookout's apps will caution you when you've logged on to an insecure network, but cannot protect you once you're there.\nIn order to protect yourself on such networks, you can use a virtual private network, or V.P.N. This turns all your activity into nonsense to anyone trying to read along with you from across the Starbucks. It also keeps websites from tracking you and, if you're traveling, allows you to get access to sites that may be blocked in other countries.\nIf you have an iPhone, the simplest V.P.N. app is probably Hotspot Shield, whose distinguishing feature is said to be that it automatically kicks in each time you start browsing  , as opposed to other V.P.N. apps that require you to start them up manually . This matters, because even if you decide you want a V.P.N. app, you want to spend approximately zero time thinking about it. For the most part, _ was true of Hotspot Shield, though occasionally it took a while to connect or temporarily lost connection without warning. I found myself having to turn the app on and off sometimes, which involved setting my phone constantly.\nIf even reading about the setting on your phone drives you crazy, then it is probably best to stay away from a V.P.N. app. But if you're the type who can't resist checking your bank balance from your comer bar, the hassle   may be preferable to the risk.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Which of the following can warn you against the insecure network? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"When we give our kids holiday gifts, many of us can't wait to hear their appreciative cries of\"thank you!\"once the wrapping gets ripped off. But here's a tip: You'd be wise not to expect much gratitude from them for what they receive.\nGratitude can make us happier, healthier, and even fitter. But do the kids show their gratitude for the stuff we buy them? All the research I've done has convinced me that it won't happen. One mom told me that when she asked her 16-year-old son to thank her for buying him a cellphone, he said, \"But that's what moms should do.\" From a teenager's angle, it's a parent's responsibility to take care of the family. According to Dunham, Yale's assistant professor of psychology, \"When teenagers code it that way, a gift is no longer something given freely and voluntarily\"--it's just mom and dad living up to their obligation.\nParents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view. Show by example that gratitude isn't aboutstuff--which ultimately can't make any of us happy anyway.It's about realizing how lucky you are and paying your good fortune forward.\nYou can collect all the charitable appeals and sit down together with the kids to go through them. You set the budget for giving and the kids decide how it's distributed. Once the conversation about gratitude gets started, it's much easier to continue all year. Also you can set up a family routine at bedtime where kids describe three things that have made them grateful. When kids go off to college, you can text them a picture each week of something that inspires your appreciation.\nTeaching children to focus on the positive and appreciate the good in their lives is perhaps the greatest gift we can give them. And we can all learn together that the things that really matter aren't on sale at a department store.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" How do children respond when receiving gifts from their parents? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"Last week Adele's second album, 21, sold 257,000 copies in the UK, a sales figure that would look incredible as an opening sales week for any album by any global superstar. The fact that the album was celebrating its 10th week at No.1, and that each of the previous nine weeks it had sold over 100,000 copies, makes what Adele has achieved look miraculous. The last female singer to spend that long at No.1 in the UK was Madonna in 1990 with her greatest hits compilation, The Immaculate Collection.\nFor Adele, the success of 21 is part of a perfect storm of talent, timing and a connection that went beyond gender, age and credibility. But what does it say about the state of the music industry? Does Adele's success signal a return to the MOR  musical depression, when the likes of James Blunt dominated the charts? Her success may well lead to a great many similar acts aiming for an MOR audience, but that's more the fault of an industry desperate to recreate any kind of success by creating poor copies until the world shouts \"stop now\".\nWhat seems to have set Adele apart is her apparent ordinariness, besides that incredible voice. While Gaga parades around in a dress made of meat and Beyonce orbits a world out of touch to the majority of most human beings, Adele's chain-smoking, girl-you'd-like-to-go-to-the-pub-with persona stands out. Even for a British act, her ordinariness goes against trend, with fellow Jessie J adopting a very American habit of over-emoting, talking about a \"journey\" and making the idea of being a pop star seem fairly difficult.\nIt's this universality and broad appeal that's helped her translate talent into sales. While the first single from 21, Rolling in the Deep, appealed to Radio 1 listeners and bloggers, the second single, Someone Like You, is so successful that silenced the grand O2 Arena during this year's Brit Awards. The press can write pages and pages in that there's enough of a connection of musicians - Rick Rubin worked on the album, there's a cover of the Cure, Mumford & Sons were an influence - while the gossip magazines have been excited by the fact that the album is one long break-up record, eager to find the ex.\nIn 1990, Madonna was a global superstar with a back catalogue of era-defining hits to her name. She was untouchable and, tellingly, unknowable. She was (and still is) a megastar, but a megastar of a different age. These days, we want to know a bit more about our artists; that they have relationship problems, walk their dog. Her selling point and appeal is precisely the fact that she exists at the point between everyday ordinariness and pop star.\nFor now, Adele's success should be celebrated, especially for becoming an unlikely global star on her own terms. The danger is that we're headed for a lot of fairly boring pop, a situation that led to the \"birth\" of Gaga a few years back. Pop goes in cycles and it feels like we're headed back towards the very middle of MOR.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Adele's achievement seems unbelievable for the reason that   _  . \n\nA. the sales of her second album achieved an incredible success last week in the UK\nB. her second album ranked first in a row with the incredible average sales per week\nC.

{"prompt":"Do we think only with the brain? Hardly. The brain is like a telephone exchange. It is the switchboard, but not the whole system. Its function is to receive incoming signals, make proper connections, and send the messages through to their destination. For efficient service, the body must function as a whole.\nBut where is the \"mind\"? Is it in the brain or perhaps in the nervous system? After all, can we say that the mind is in any particular place? It is not a thing, like a leg, or even the brain. It is a function, an activity. Aristotle, twenty-three hundred years ago, observed that the mind was to the body what cutting was to the ax. When the ax is not in use, there is no cutting. So it is with the mind. \"Mind,\" said Charles H. Woolbert, \"is what the body is doing.\"\nIf this activity is necessary for thinking, it is also necessary for carrying thought from one person to another. Observe how people go about the business of ordinary conversation. If you have never done this carefully, you have a surprise in store, for good conversationalists are almost constantly in motion. Their heads are continually nodding and shaking sometimes so vigorously that you wonder how their necks can stand the strain. Even the legs and feet are active. As for the hands and arms, they are seldom still for more than a few seconds at a time.\nThese people, remember, are not making speeches. They are only common people trying to make others understand what they have in mind. They are not conscious of movement. Their speech is not studies. They are just human creatures in a human environment, trying to adapt themselves to a social situation.

{"prompt":"As rain begins to fall from the clouds, it is very pure. However, as it falls through the air it dissolves some of the gases in the air.

If the water supply is not clean, people who drink this water may get these diseases. Thus, to provide people with clean water, the government purifies   the water.\n  Purification is a long process and includes three stages: storing, purifying and distributing .

This water is usually dirty and muddy. \n  In the second stage, water from the man-made lakes is filtered   in a special pond. Stones, sand and other unwanted tiny things are caught in it. After that, tiny microbes are still present in the water. These microbes are removed by \"airing\" the water and by adding a chemical substance called chlorine   to the water. This kills all the microbes in the water. After this, the water can be safely used for drinking.\nThe third stage is the distribution of the purified water to homes, hospitals, offices, factories and other places. This is done through a network of pipes of various sizes. These pipes must be made of a suitable material.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What can we know about man-made lakes? \n\nA.

A program titled Most Extreme Airports, rated the airport as the most dangerous airport in the world. The airport is popular because Lukla is the place where most people start the climb to Mount Everest Base Camp. High wind, cloud cover, and changing visibility often mean flights can be delayed or the airport closed. The airport's runway is accessible only to helicopters and small, fixed-wing, short-takeoff-and-landing aircraft. The runway is only 527m with an elevation of 2,845m.\nPrincess Juliana International Airport\nPrincess Juliana International Airport is in the country of Saint Maarten. The airport is perhaps best known for very low-altitude flyover landing approaches due to one end of its runway being extremely close to the shore and Maho Beach. The thrilling approaches and ease of access for shooting spectacular images make the airport one of the world's favorite places among plane spotters.\nGibraltar Airport\nGibraltar Airport serves the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, a tiny peninsula with an area of only 6.8 square kilometers.

{"prompt":"The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: \" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.\"\nEver since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins.\nThe effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad.\nThe real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The Norwegian Government would prefer the oil industry to   _  . \n\nA. provide more jobs for foreign workers\nB. slow down the rate of its development\nC. sell the oil it is producing abroad\nD. develop more quickly than at present\nAnswer = B\n\nThe Norwegian Government has tried to   _  . \n\nA. encourage the oil companies to discover new oil sources\nB. prevent oil companies employing people from northern Norway\nC. help the oil companies solve many of their problems\nD. keep the oil industry to something near its present size\nAnswer = D\n\nAccording to the passage, the oil industry might lead northern Norway to   _  . \n\nA. the development of industry\nB. a growth in population\nC. the failure of the development program\nD. the development of new towns\nAnswer = C\n\nIn the south, one effect to the development of the oil industry might be   _  . \n\nA. a large reduction on unemployment\nB. a growth in the tourist industry\nC. a reduction in the number of existing industries\nD. the development of a number of service industries\nAnswer = C\n\nNorwegian farmers and fishermen have an important influence because   _  . \n\nA. they form such a large part of Norwegian ideal\nB. their lives and values represent the Norwegian ideal\nC. their work is so useful to the rest of Norwegian society\nD. they regard oil as a threat to the Norwegian way of life\nAnswer = B\n\n"}

Do you know why so many people wanted to reach the top of the world?\n     It was breathtaking. It was wonderful and a bit of frightening. It was Qomolangma, the highest mountain in the world. For many years, it has attracted tens of thousands of people who tried to climb its dangerous slopes. During May's 60th anniversary of the first successful climb, nearly 600 people from around the world, including a 5-year-old Italian boy, tried to reach the \"roof of the world\". China Central Television(CCTV) also sent a team to join the adventure. It broadcasted a special program, called \"Standing at the world's third pole in 2013\", from May 18 to 24 to cover the Chinese climbing Qomolangma. Over the last century, the 8848-metre-high peak has proven a great challenge for mountaineers. Those who try to stand on top of the world do so at great risk from extremely cold, avalanches , and falling ice. At 8,500 meters, the air contains just one-third of the oxygen at sea level, requiring most climbers to use oxygen tanks. Some of those who climbed the mountain paid the highest price---175 people have lost their lives on the slopes.\n     On May29, 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary from New Zealand and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal became the first men ever to reach the top of the mountain. Nearly half a century later, the sons of the two pioneers, Peter Hillary and Jaming Tenzing Norgay, followed in their fathers' footsteps. In 2002, they also successfully reached the roof of the world.\n     Over the last 60 years, more than 10,000 men and women have tried to climb the mountain and more than 1,200 have succeeded. The first Chinese climbers reached the top of the mountain in 1960.\n     Despite the dangers, many different people are drawn towards the challenge.

{"prompt":"Science is a dominant theme in our culture. Since it touches almost every aspect of our life, educated people need at least some idea of its structure and operation. They should also have an understanding of the subculture in which scientists live and the kinds of people they are. An understanding of general characteristics of science as well as specific scientific concepts is easier to obtain if one knows something about the things that excite and frustrate the scientist.\nThis book is written for the intelligent student or lay   person whose knowledge of science is superficial; for the person who has been presented with science as a musty storehouse of dried facts; for the person who sees the chief objective of science as the production of small devices; and for the person who views the scientists as some sort of magician.\nThe book can be used to supplement a course in any science, to accompany any course that attempts to give an understanding of the modern world, or independently of any course, simply to provide a better understanding of science. We hope this book will lead readers to a broader perspective on scientific attitudes and a more realistic view of what science is, who scientists are, and what they do.\nIt will give them an awareness and understanding of the relationship between science and our culture and an appreciation of the roles science may play in our culture. In addition, readers may learn to appreciate the relationship between scientific views and some of the values and philosophies that are widespread in our culture.\nWe have tried to present in this book an accurate and up-to-date picture of the scientific community and the people who populate it. That population has in recent years come to consist of more and more women. This increasing role of women in the scientific subculture is not an unique incident but, rather, part of the trend evident in all parts of society as more women enter traditionally male-dominated fields and make significant contributions.\nIn discussing these changes and contribution, however, we are faced with a language that is somewhat sexist, one that uses male nouns or pronouns in referring to unspecified individuals. To balance this built-in bias  , we have adopted the policy of using plural nouns and pronouns whenever possible and , when absolutely necessary, alternating him and her.\nThis policy is far from being ideal, but it is at least an acknowledgement of the inadequacy of our language in treating half of the human race equally.\nWe have also tried to make the book entertaining as well as informative. Our approach is usually informal. We feel, as many other scientists do, that we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously.

Julius Caesar, the Roman ruler who defeated almost all the countries in Europe about 2,000 years ago, used a cipher when he sent secret messages to his troops. During the American Revolution, George Washington's spies used a kind of code to send his information about the enemy before his military action. In World War II, the Americans\"broke\"or figured out Japan's most important navy codes and got enough information to destroy a powerful Japanese fleet.\nStorekeepers use codes to mark their goods. The codes show how much is paid for the goods or when they are added to the stock. Businessmen use codes to hide plans from their business enemies. Sometimes personal letters or diaries are written in code. Many people enjoy figuring out codes and ciphers simply as a hobby.\nIn the 16th century, codes and ciphers were very popular among scientists. They wrote messages to each other in code so that no one else would learn their secrets. Geronimo Gardano, an Italian astrologer  , mathematician, and doctor, invented the trellis cipher. He took two sheets of paper and cut exactly the same holes in each one. Then he sent one sheet, which he called a trellis, to a friend and kept the other for himself. Whenever he wanted to write a message, he put his trellis over a clean sheet of paper and wrote the secret message through the holes. There he removed the trellis and filled the rest of the paper with words that would make sense. When his friend received it, he put his trellis over the writing and read the secret message.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The best title of this passage would be  _  . \n\nA. Codes and ciphers\nB.

{"prompt":"An Australian company, Smart Car Technologies, has developed a system that lets drivers know when they're speeding. When the technology becomes commercially available, it could help lead-footed drivers avoid tickets and also save lives. The company that developed the product hopes to convince Australian government agencies to put the technology into use in their automobile fleets.\nThe product, called Speed Alert, links real-time location data and speed obtained with the help of GPS to a database of posted speed limits stored in a driver's PDA or programmable mobile phone. The setup of the product does not need to be hooked up to a car's speedometer. In fact, it is entirely portable. It will also work with newer phones and PDAs that have built-in GPS receivers. If a driver exceeds the speed limit, the speed is shown and an alert sounds.\nMichael Paine, an Australian vehicle design engineer and traffic safety consultant, was hired to analyze the product. He told Live Science that his colleagues in the road safety field are \"very enthusiastic\" about what they're now calling \"intelligent speed alert.\" Other research, according to Paine, shows that 40 percent of all traffic deaths involve speeding. There is also a potentially controversial future use: \"Since the system is so portable, it would be easy to make it a requirement for teenage drivers to always use a speed alert device when driving,\" Paine said. \"The system even has the capability to record speeding violations, so parents can monitor their teenage drivers.\"\nThe product will soon go on sale in Sydney.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What's the purpose of the new product? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"Ideas about education are changing in the United States. Education today is not just a high school diploma   or a college degree. Many adults are not interested in going to college. They are interested in other kinds of learning. For them, learning does not end with a diploma. Continuing education gives these adults the chance to increase their knowledge. It also gives them a chance to improve their old skills or to learn new ones. If they know more or learn more, then they can get a better job or earn more money.\n    There are usually a large number of classes to choose from. Some adults learn new skills. Some take classes for fun or because the class will be useful for them. Others take classes to improve their own lives because they want to feel better about themselves.

Almost any community college or public school system has a continuing education program. There are classes in schools, buildings, or churches. Most classes are in the evening, so working people can attend. The classes are usually small, and they are inexpensive. Thousands of people take continuing education classes each year.

At last, I found a place near the back.\nThe man in the seat next to the one I was going for was an older man in a grey suit, well-worn dress shoes, and a black hat like I always pictured reporters wearing, but without the little press card. Seated, I began to read the book I had been carrying, which was Jack Kerouac's On the Road. The man in the seat next to me introduced himself by asking if I had read any other book like the one I was holding. When I told him I had, he seemed to become interested, and so did I. He introduced himself as Carl and asked if I liked jazz, and I told him that I didn't really listen to it, and that I liked rock and roll. Waiting for Carl to tell me that I should listen to real music, I was shocked when he just smiled and nodded. He said, \"You remind me of myself when I was your age. I remember how my parents hated jazz and how they couldn't see how I could listen to that awful noise. I bet your parents say the same thing, don't they?\" Now it was my turn to smile, amused with how right he was.\nAs the bus carried us from one side of the city to the other, Carl and I talked about a lot of different things. The more we talked, the more amazed I became at how much the two of us really had in common, despite the age difference. I haven't seen him since we parted, but the thought of our connection that day rarely leaves my mind.\nCarl really made me think about how much we can learn from each other if we just break through the blocks between us we've got. I mean, I would have never thought before that day that I could have anything in common with someone so much older than I. But Carl taught me that no matter what we are, we are all just people, and that we should make an extra effort to try and get to know our neighbors and people we see every day, regardless of age, race, religion, sex, or anything else. If we all take the time to attempt to understand each other, I think that the world would be a much better place that we could share together, as humans.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The author usually imagined a reporter as one who   _  . \n\nA. liked jazz music\nB. enjoyed talking with others\nC. liked reading Jack Kerouac's works\nD. usually wore a black hat and press card\nAnswer = D\n\nAfter talking with Carl, the author realized that   _  . \n\nA. older people were nice to talk to\nB. he should have known Carl earlier\nC. his parents were so different from Carl in listening to music\nD. age was not necessarily a problem in heart-to-heart communication\nAnswer = D\n\nIt can be inferred from the passage that   _  . \n\nA. the author hasn't seen the old man since then\nB. jazz music used to be more popular than rock and roll\nC. the author was not satisfied with human relationships in the world\nD.

{"prompt":"The first memory I have of him---of anything, really---is his strength. It was in the late afternoon in a house under construction near ours. The unfinished wood floor had large, terrifying holes whose big and opening darkness I knew led to nowhere good. His powerful hands, then age 33, wrapped all the way around my tiny arms, then age 4, and easily swung me up to his shoulders to command all I surveyed.\nThe relationship between a son and his father changes over time. It may grow and flourish in mutual maturity. It may sour in hated dependence or independence. With many children living in single-parent homes today, it may not even exist.\nBut to a little boy right after World War II, a father seemed a god with strange strengths and strange powers enabling him to do and know things that no mortal could do or know. Amazing things, like putting a bicycle chain back on, just like that, or building a hamster cage, or guiding a jigsaw so it forms the letter F; I learned the alphabet that way in those pre-television days.\nThere were, of course, rules to learn. First came the handshake, a good firm squeeze accompanied by an equally strong gaze into the other's eyes. \"The first thing anyone knows about you is your handshake,\" he would say. And we'd practice it each night on his return from work, the serious toddler in the old Cleveland Indian's cap running up to the giant father to shake hands again and again until it was firm enough.\nOne day, I realize now, there was a change. I wasn't trying to please him so much as I was trying to impress him. I never asked him to come to my football games. He had a high-pressure career, and it meant driving through most of Friday night. But for all the big games, when I looked over at the sideline, there was that familiar fedora . And by God, did the opposing team captain ever get a firm handshake and a gaze he would remember?\nThen, a school fact contradicted something he said. Impossible that he could be wrong, but there it was in the book. These accumulated over time, along with personal experiences, to strengthen my own developing sense of values. And I could tell we had each taken our own, perfectly normal paths. I began to see, too, his blind spots, his prejudices and his weaknesses. I never threw these up at him. He hadn't to me, and, anyway, he seemed to need protection. I stopped asking his advice; the experiences he drew from no longer seemed relevant to the decisions I had to make. \nHe volunteered advice for a while. But then, in more recent years, politics and issues gave way to talk of empty errands and, always, to illness.\nAfter much thought and practice \" You can do whatever you have to do.\", one night last winter, I sat down by his bed and remembered for an instant those terrifying dark holes in another house 35 years before. I told my father how much I loved him. I described all the things people were doing for him. But, I said, he kept eating poorly, hiding in his room and violating the doctor's orders. No amount of love could make someone else care about life, I said; it was a two-way street. He wasn't doing his best. The decision was his.\nHe said he knew how hard my words had been to say and how proud he was of me. \"I had the best teacher,\" I said. \"You can do whatever you have to do.\" He smiled a little. And we shook hands, firmly, for the last time.\nSeveral days later, at about 4 A.M., my mother heard Dad shuffling about their dark room. \" I have some things I have to do,\" he said. He paid a bundle of bills. He composed for my mother a long list of legal and financial what-to-do's \" in case of emergency.\" And he wrote me a note.\nThen he walked back to his bed and laid himself down. He went to sleep, naturally. And he did not wake up.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" From the passage we can infer that   _  . \n\nA. there was no television when the writer was learning the alphabet\nB. the writer's father was a god who could do many things with strength\nC. the writer's father lived a poor life and couldn't support his family\nD. they practiced shaking hands until the writer grew up\nAnswer = A\n\nAccording to the passage we can see that the writer's father was   _  . \n\nA. sensitive and strong\nB. considerate and responsible\nC. strict and humorous\nD. determined and weak\nAnswer = B\n\nHow old was the writer's father probably when he died? \n\nA. 33\nB. 58\nC. 68\nD. 78\nAnswer = C\n\n"}

{"prompt":"I do desire to help my Chinese students to find a better way of learning. I once divided my Chinese MBA students into six groups and set them an assignment: brainstorming on \"two-hour business plans\", for example: a restaurant chain. Originality would be valued most. As a result, five groups proposed projects for restaurant chains. The sixth showed a catering service. I couldn't help expressing my disappointment, though the time limit had been rather challenging.\nThose middle managers and financial analysts from state-owned enterprises and global companies were not untalented or without opinions, but they had been accustomed to an educational system that rarely rewarded critical thinking or Originality.

Students insisted that copying was a superior business strategy, better than inventing and creating.\nIn China, you can see almost all kinds of products you can imagine have been made and sold, but so few well developed marketing and management minds have been produced that it will be a long time before most people in the world can name a Chinese brand!\nPartnerships with institutions like Yale and MIT have been established so as to solve the problem mentioned above.

{"prompt":"What is freedom? It seems like such a simple question. Freedom is being able to do what you want to do. Allow me to explain it.\nI'm tired of working for a living. I'd rather collect taxes. So that's what I'm going to do: collect a kind of tax. You are ordered to estimate your income from the past 12 months, and write me a check for 1%. I have provided a mailing address for this purpose on my contact page ...\nWhat? You have a problem with my plan? Oh, I see. If you have to send me a check for the tax, then I have hurt your freedom to spend that money as you see fit. We have a conflict! And our basic problem is: we cannot enjoy freedom at the same time; we must settle for a limit. But what limit?\nLibertarians   believe freedom should be based on self-control. They describe freedom as being able to do what you want to do as long as it doesn't influence the equal right of others to do what they want to do. That is, freedom is being able to do what you like as long as you do not harm another person's life, liberty or property.\nYou can build a set of legal and ethical   rules on the principle of self-control, and libertarians do. Their request for self-control often becomes more important than common sense, or even freedom itself.\nThe definition rules out the freedom to steal, murder, and so on. Otherwise, you can do whatever you want. There is no problem until you realize that taxation is theft, that war is murder, and that national service is a form of slavery. Since only the government has a legal right to use force, libertarians focus on making the government smaller, or even going without it. The libertarians' definition of freedom is thus freedom from the government.

The Russians were mainly interested in the wealth of furs from the vast herds of seals they found there.\nBy the mid-1800's, most of the seal herds had been wiped out, and Russia no longer wanted to keep Alaska. William Seward, Secretary of State for President Johnson, believed the United States should buy Alaska from Russia. President Johnson wasn't so sure it was a wise way to spend U.S. money, but he agreed to let Seward discuss it with the Russians. Acting quickly, Seward made a deal. On March 30, 1867, he signed an agreement for the U.S. to pay seven million dollars for the land.\nMany people thought it was a foolish waste of America's money. They called the deal \"Seward's folly\". Then gold was discovered in Alaska and public opinion changed quickly.\nSeward did not live to see the true value of Alaska. He died in 1872, five years after making the purchase  . Each year, Alaska's natural resources  have brought in many times the $7,000,000 paid for it.

{"prompt":"Nearly everyone agrees that money doesn't buy as much as it used to, no matter when you want to spend it. This is certainly true of the paper money that passes so quickly through one's hands. But what about coins that seem to do very little except stay in purses and pockets? Unlike notes, metal money becomes more valuable the longer it is held, especially if it is put away where it won't get scratched or worn. Why is this? One reason is that coins, being more durable, fall more readily into a category for collectors. Naturally, the rarer gold pieces must become more valuable as the price of this metal goes up.\nBut, curiously, one of the rarest coins in the world is not made of gold, but of the relatively cheaper silver. In 1840, the United States mint   struck 19570 silver dollars. That is what its records show. Today only six of this original number remain and these are unlikely ever to reach the auction   market. So what happened to some 19564 large silver coins, not the easiest sort of things to lose? One of the more romantic theories is that they were part of the payment to Napoleon for the American land then known as Louisiana. But they never reached France. Somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico, the ship transporting them was sunk, either by a storm or by pirates. The probable answer to the mystery is that they were melted down -- since the silver value was greater than the actual value of the coin. What really happened to the rest will probably always remain a mystery.

Seeing an injured seal wrapped in a blanket at a marine  mammal center gave Haley Humes and Hayley Jeffries an idea for a special Girl Scout project.

They would give these blankets to the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach, California.\n\"We knew we wanted to help animals,\" Haley said. \"We went to the center to ask questions about what they needed. They don't have a heated floor, and all the babies crowded together to stay warm.\"\nFriends since kindergarten, Haley and Hayley made 12 blankets to keep the Marine Mammal Center's seals and sea lions warm. Using fun images like Winnie-the-Pooh, the girls took two hours to make each blanket. The first sea lion to test out a blanket looked pretty in pink.\n\"It was a sick baby and really liked it,\" Haley said. \"It curled up in it right away.\"\n\"The blankets are beautiful and the animals love them!\" said the Mammal Center's Michele Hunter. \"It's nice to see children taking pride in their work and doing something to help animals.\"\nDuring the project, the girls took dozens of pictures for the PowerPoint presentations they gave to Girl Scout leaders. Those presentations helped Haley and Hayley raise $250 to buy additional supplies the center needed.\nThis was the first project the girls ever worked on and took months to plan and carry out.\n\"I learned that in order to make something happen, you have to take it slowly and step by step,\" Hayley said.

{"prompt":"For many people, the story of cottages -- small vacation homes away from the city -- is a deeply personal one. For some families, cottages have been the scene of reunions, vacations and family adventures for generations.\nIn North America, \"cottaging \" really began during the 19th century. At that time, crowds of people were moving from family farms to cities. Naturally, these people often felt a _ for the natural beauty of the countryside. Frequently located near lakes, in the mountains of woods, cottages provided a perfect solution.\nTraditionally small and rustic  ,many cottages were once simple log  homes without bathrooms, water or electricity. While in most cases that is no longer true, people still go to cottages in large numbers to escape the city and to enjoy \"cottage life.\"\nDespite the peaceful setting, there is always plenty to do at a cottage. If you enjoy outdoor activities, try hunting, boating or hiking. Many cottages are located near a lake, so you have opportunities to go swimming, boating or sunbathing around. Enjoy a picnic with your family, or build a campfire to roast hot dogs. On rainy days, curl up  on a comfortable chair inside and read, or enjoy board games   with your friends and relatives. Want to get out and explore? Take a tour of the lake in a motorboat, or visit one of the many small villages located nearby.\nMany families rent cottages instead of owning them, but for those who do, there's always work to be done. Wood must be chopped for the stove. Leaves need to be gathered and gardens taken care of.

{"prompt":"About 10 years ago my daughter was about 2500 kilometers from Newcastle, and rang me one day crying because of an emotional problem she was facing. She was about 20, and in a town known as Ayrlie Beach in Northern Queensland. I asked her what it was that she needed most in that moment, and she replied that she needed support, and my arms around her would be the best thing that she could hope for! Because I couldn't do that in that exact moment, I asked her to describe her surroundings to me (I have  ly no idea 'why', at the time), and said that if she hadn't heard from me in about 30 minutes, she could ring me back. I asked her to stay exactly where she was.\nAfter hanging up the phone, I just sat for a few seconds. After only a very short time a phone number jumped into my head. I rang the number and it was a woman who had bought a house from me about 18 months previously, when I was working in Real Estate.

Have you any idea why?\"\n\"It could be because my son lives there,\" says Liz.\n\"Oh really, that's got to be it,\" I said. \"Do you mind giving me his phone number, Liz?\"\n\"Of course not, and I can only hope that he can be of some help!\"\nI rang straight away (only about 5 minutes have passed since telling my daughter that somehow I'd get her help). Fortunately, he answered immediately, and I told him the story of who I was, and why I'd rung.\nI gave him the description of my daughter; where she was standing; and that she needed emotional support if he could find it in his heart to help out so unexpectedly like this. \"Oh yes, I can see her,\" he said...\"she's right across the street from where I'm standing!\" He walked across the street and told my daughter that her Dad had sent him!\nImagine that...she almost fainted: only about 10 minutes had passed since she had rung me!

{"prompt":"Gray hair is simply a part of the normal aging process, and the rate you go silver is genetically predetermined. Going gray is not associated with earlier death, and premature graying is not, generally speaking, a sign of an illness or ill health in younger adults. There are, however, some specific health conditions associated with gray or white hair, but for most of us, going gray is just a fact of life. \nHair color1 comes from the pigment melanin , which determines your individual shade. Hair without any melanin is pure white. The pigment is produced in cells called melanocytes, which inject pigment into the hair. At some point in everyone's lifetime, these cells slow down and eventually stop producing color1. Scientists have yet to identify the exact mechanism by which melanocyte cell death occurs. \nA study of more than 4,000 women and men from 20 countries determined that about 75% of people between the ages of 45 and 65 have some gray hair. In general, people of European descent gray earliest followed by Asians and Africans. It's interesting to note that a lucky 1 in 10 has no gray hair by retirement age. Beginning at age 30, your chances of having gray hair go up 10-20% per decade. \nIt may feel like you have more grays after a stressful event, but that's probably because middle age is basically a series of anxiety-ridden events. Between working, raising kids, and caring for older parents, the \"sandwich\" years of 45-65 can be stressful, especially for women. They are also when we naturally start to look older. \nAt this point, there is still no silver bullet to keep away the grays.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What would be the best title for this passage? \n\nA.

{"prompt":"Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) suggests.\nThe three-year project found that only 21 % of children aged 8 --12 were \"connected to nature\". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back.\nThere has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour.\nThe RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what \"connected               to nature\" actually means and then deve -loped a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children.\nSome 1, 200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21 % of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This \"realistic and achievable\" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organization.\nOne interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27 % of girls were at or above the \"realistic and achievable\" target, only 16 % of boys were at the same level. \"We need to understand these differences,\" Sue Armstrong Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC New. \"Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyze the data to find that out.\"\nThe report also stressed significant regional differences.

They offered various explanations but were not at all sure how the hole had been caused, it was thought that a large bomb which came suddenly exploded, but it was not possible to prove this. A simple, but highly improbable explanation was offered by a man who declares to know well about \"flying saucers\"; the strange objects which are round in shape and are said to visit the earth from outer space. The man's explanation may have been nonsense  , but at least it was imaginative. At any rate, it was far more interesting than the one given by the army.\nAfter examining the ground carefully the man declared to have seen special marks on the soil quite near the hole, these, he said, could only have been caused by a flying saucer. Moreover the leaves on some bushes nearby had turned yellow because of a strange hot gas which had come from the saucer just before it landed. Even a small tree some way off appeared to have been burnt slightly. A small piece of metal found in the hole itself gave further proof that a strange object had been there. According to the man, it was quite clear that people from another world had been going around the earth trying to pick up information, when something had gone wrong. Because of this they had been forced to land in a field so that the damage could be repaired. The hole had been caused when the saucer struck the earth, while the strange marks nearby were made when it took off again.

I completely panic when meeting new people, I only stay in classes that don't require any talking on my part. It seems the only place I'm actually happy is at home or with people that I've known all my life. Hope you can help! \n \nDear Lisa,\n    About 5 million Americans have some form of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia. While everyone experiences nervousness or fear in social situations to a certain extent, those with social anxiety disorder are weakened by their fear. They may have a constant, intense, and lasting fear of being watched and judged by others, or be terribly afraid of being embarrassed or laughed at by ways in which they behave. As you have described, this fear can prevent people with social anxiety disorder from doing everyday activities, such as going to school or work, and can become so much of a focus that they limit their socializing.\n    It's understandable that you are worried about how your parents might react to knowing what's been going on for you. Many people think that their families will blame them for how they're feeling or _ their concerns. Being honest with your parents, however, might help you to feel more at ease; it's possible that they've noticed your behavior and wondered about it, or even struggled with similar feelings themselves. There's even some evidence that anxiety disorders may be genetic or run in families --perhaps due to environmental factors and patterns expressed through interpersonal interactions.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The problem of Lisa is that  _  . \n\nA.

{"prompt":"The canopy, the upper level of the trees in the rain forest, holds too much of climbing\nmammals   of moderately large size, which may include monkeys, cats, civets, and\nporcupines. Smaller species, including such as nice and small squirrels, are not as common\noverall in high tropical canopies as they are in most habitats globally.\nSmall mammals, being warm blooded, suffer hardship in the exposed and uncertain\nenvironment of the uppermost trees. Because a small body has more surface area per unit of\nweight than a large one of similar shape, it gains or loses heat more rapidly. Thus, in the trees,\nwhere protection from heat and cold may be scarce and conditions may be changeable, a\nsmall mammal may have trouble maintaining its body temperature.\nSmall size makes it easy to scramble among twigs   and branches in the canopy for\ninsects, flowers, or fruit, but small mammals are defeated, in the competition for food, by\nlarge ones that have their own strategies for browsing among tbod-rich twigs. The weight of\nan ape hanging below a branch draws the leaves down so that fruit-bearing leaves drop\ntoward the ape's face. Walking or leaping species of a similar or even larger size access the\nouter twigs either by breaking and gaining the whole branch or by catching hold of hard\nbranches with the feet or tail and picking food with their hands.\nSmall climbing animals may reach twigs readily, but it is harder for them than for large\nclimbing animals to cross the wide gaps from one tree top to the next that typify the high\ncanopy. A gibbon can hurl itself farther than a mouse can: it can achieve a running start, and it\ncan more effectively use a branch as a springboard  .

{"prompt":"Now, we know that if we do not get enough vitamins, we are at risk of developing a number of diseases. As a result, vitamin supplements ,though expensive, are popular with people who worry that they are not getting enough vitamins from the foods they eat. But contrary to what many people think, medical experts have found little evidence that most supplements do anything to improve health or protect against disease. \nIn fact, medical experts warn that taking too many of some vitamins can be harmful. For example, too much vitamin E can cause bleeding. People should discuss what vitamins they take with their doctors, as some vitamins can produce harmful side effects when mixed with medicines.\nExperts, however, do say that sometimes vitamins can help prevent disease. People who know they lack a particular vitamin should take vitamin supplements. Some older adults, for example, may not have enough vitamin B-twelve. This is because, as people get older, their body loses its ability to take it from foods. Also, people who spend much time inside may need some extra vitamin D as the skin makes this vitamin from sunlight.\nDifferent vitamins are found in different foods. Vitamin A is found in fish liver oil. It also is in the yellow part of eggs. Sweet potatoes, carrots and other darkly color1ed fruits and vegetables contain substances that the body can change into vitamin A. Vitamin B-twelve is found in green leafy vegetables and other foods, like fruits. Vitamin K can be found in pork products.\nIn fact, for most people, a balanced diet can ensure enough of the vitamins our bodies need. So, it is important for us to eat a mixture of foods every day to ensure that we get enough vitamins our bodies need.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" What is probably talked about before this passage? \n\nA.
